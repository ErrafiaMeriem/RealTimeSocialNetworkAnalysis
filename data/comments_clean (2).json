        "clean_comment": "we are not relying on israeli claims alone. hamas’ use of civilian infrastructure is documented by un bodies (including unrwa complaints, awkwardly enough), human rights watch, amnesty international, western and arab journalists, video evidence released by hamas itself, statements by hamas leaders openly praising “martyrdom of civilians.” hamas leaders have explicitly said civilian deaths are useful politically. that alone breaks the symmetry. hamas fires from these locations. not “stores and leaves,” not “moves weapons elsewhere to fight.” rockets are launched from schoolyards, command centers operate inside hospitals, tunnels run under classrooms. that is operational use, not concealment. the british hypothetical is fiction if the british blew up a school in 1946 it would be because weapons were found there, not because attacks were launched from there while children were present. there is no evidence of the haganah systematically fighting from schools with civilians inside. so no, this isn’t “irony.” it’s a false equivalence built on a hypothetical instead of evidence. now, second claim. yes, haganah committed atrocities. but saying “they committed atrocities” is not the same as saying “civilian harm was doctrine.”tohar haneshek existed as a norm, not as a guarantee. violations of restraint were debated internally, sometimes condemned, often justified as exceptional or retaliatory. that already distinguishes it from hamas, where attacks on civilians are celebrated, not apologized for, killing civilians is framed as religious duty. there is no concept of “violation.” it is the mission. if a rule is broken, the rule still exists. if there is no rule, nothing is broken. that distinction matters morally and legally. one massacre does not define doctrine. if it did, every army on earth would be defined solely by its worst day. the haganah did not adopt a policy of massacring villages as a standing strategy. hamas does adopt civilian targeting as a standing strategy.",

'no zionist can forgo the smallest portion of the land of israel,' ben-gurion was quoted as saying. (<url> ... it might be noted that the “boundaries of zionist aspirations” in ben gurion’s “vision” were quite broad, including southern lebanon, southern syria, today’s jordan, all of cis-jordan, and the sinai. this was, in fact, one of ben-gurion’s constant themes. in internal discussion in 1938, he stated that “after we become a strong force, as the result of the creation of a state, we shall abolish partition and expand to the whole of palestine. the state will only be a stage in the realization of zionism and its task is to prepare the ground for our expansion into the whole of palestine by a jewish-arab agreement. the state will have to preserve order not only by preaching morality but by machine guns, if necessary.” the “agreement” that ben-gurion had in mind was to be with king abdullah of jordan, who would be induced to cede areas of cis-jordan under his control, while many of the arab residents would leave. earlier, ben-gurion had explained to arab interlocutors that “our land” included transjordan, and that it extended from the sinai to “the source of the jordan.” in internal discussion he urged that “we do not suggest now to announce the final aim,” which is “far-reaching,” even more so than the aim of those who were opposing partition. “i am unwilling to abandon the great jewish vision, the final vision,” he added. this vision, here unspecified in scale, “is an organic, spiritual and ideological component of my jewishness and my zionist aspiration,” ben-gurion explained. (<url> ... although the jewish agency accepted the partition plan, it did not accept the proposed borders as final and israel's declaration of independence avoided the mention of any boundaries. a state in part of palestine was seen as a stage towards a larger state when opportunity allowed. although the borders were “bad from a military and political point of view,” ben gurion urged fellow jews to accept the un partition plan, pointing out that arrangements are never final, “not with regard to the regime, not with regard to borders, and not with regard to international agreements.” the idea of partition being a temporary expedient dated back to the peel partition proposal of 1937. when the zionist congress had rejected partition on the grounds that the jews had an inalienable right to settle anywhere in palestine, ben gurion had argued in favour of acceptance: “i see in the realisation of this plan practically the decisive stage in the beginning of full redemption and the most wonderful lever for the gradual conquest of all of palestine.” (<url> “after the formation of a large army in the wake of the establishment of the state, we will abolish partition and expand to the whole of palestine.” — ben gurion, p. 22, the birth of israel (1987), simha flapan. “if it was permissible to move an arab from the galilee to judea, why it is impossible to move an arab from hebron to transjordan, which is much closer? there are vast expanses of land there and we are overcrowded. even the high commission agrees to a transfer to transjordan if we equip the peasants with land and money. if the peel commission and the london government accept, we’ll remove the land problem from the agenda.”",

        "clean_comment": "the name palestine has existed for thousands of years, with the earliest known reference, peleset, appearing in ancient egyptian inscriptions from around 1150 bce. the greek historian herodotus was the first to use the term palaistine (παλαιστίνη) in written records to refer to the broader geographical area or a district of syria, including the judean mountains and the jordan rift valley. this usage was common among greek and roman writers. during the byzantine era, the region was further divided into palaestina prima, secunda, and salutaris. following the 7th-century muslim conquest, the area was established as the military district of jund filastin. the arabic term filastin has been used for the region since that time. edit: i gotta ask…what was the point of this post? lets just get to root of your beliefs go with your lie that palestine didn’t exist until 1959. what exactly are you saying that means for palestinian people? is this your justification for exterminating them or evicting them from the land? is this a justification for denying palestinians an independent state? are you trying to justify viewing them as lesser people, subhuman even?? please do me the favor of cutting through the bs and get to the point",

(the acropolis style temples at leveled mountaintops shimmering in the clouds caused ancient people even including visitors from greece and rome to become speechless in awe.). also (and this has always puzzled me and been one of the things that personally attached me most to the jewish people, judaism and zionism), where are the hittites? the edomites? the phonicuans?

(both war crimes) 4. israel tries to navigate the thus created highly chaotic urban warzone, by letting people evacuate, but is shot at from non combat zones from sniper or rocket launcher spots, which nearly always happen to sit on top of homes, hospitals, schools, etc. 5. israel bombs the thus created military infrastructure (look at rules for international warfare) to protect their soldiers. 6. hamas publishes horrifying videos of the children israel supposedly killed on purpose, by bombing a house or school, conveniently leaving out step 1-5. 7. people in the west that have no clue about war zones and their rules start rioting. not to say, that the likud isn’t a party of racist a-holes that need to go down, or that there aren’t racists in the idf that use their power to torment and unnecessarily kill palestinian civilians. or that the slow land grabbing in the west bank shouldn’t stop. but i highly doubt that any of the people protesting even have the hint of an idea, how many of those civilian deaths are actually due to hamas war tactics, that are specifically designed to get their own people killed as martyrs and their deaths used as war propaganda in the west. a tactic that seems to work, looking at the amount of help money that hamas related organizations in western countries have already funneled directly to hamas before they were uncovered. if hamas was a normal government that fought to protect their citizens and provided shelter in bunkers for the civilians, the numbers of deaths would be a clearer sign of intend. since that is not the case, the sole number of supposedly civilians dying (which is also provided by hamas) is not really telling us anything except the tragedy of loss of human lives. but not deliberate “slaughter” by israelis.",

        "clean_comment": "i appreciate you sharing your perspective as a european observer. it’s a complex situation, but to have a truly balanced conversation, there are several factual and legal points that need to be cleared up regarding the claims you’ve made. first, it is a common misconception that arab-israeli citizens (who make up about 21% of the population) have inferior legal status. under israeli law, they have full and equal rights: they vote in every election, hold seats in the knesset (parliament), and serve as judges on the supreme court. in fact, an arab party was part of the governing coalition recently. while there are certainly socioeconomic disparities and historical tensions - much like minority populations face in europe - it is inaccurate to say they lack the same rights as jewish citizens. regarding the idea that 10 7 was a protest that turned into ‘chaos’ or that atrocities were ‘propaganda’: multiple international bodies, including the un and human rights watch, have documented that the attacks involved systematic massacres, torture, sexual violence, and kidnapping. captured documents and body-cam footage from the attackers themselves showed that the targeting of civilians was not an accident, but a pre-planned objective with specific maps of civilian communities. you asked why the division didn’t happen. it’s important to note that israel has agreed to a two-state solution multiple times, as op mentioned. beyond the 1947 partition, israel made significant offers in the oslo accords, camp david summits, and the 2008 olmert plan, which would have seen the creation of a palestinian state on nearly all of the west bank and gaza. these offers were rejected by palestinian leadership. regarding the us 20-point plan you mentioned- that framework actually requires the complete demilitarization of gaza and the removal of hamas from power to ensure safety for both sides. it would require both leaderships to protect their civilians, something hamas failed to do by using civilian infrastructure for military purposes. finally, i’m not sure if you realize that israel is a self-critical democracy. there is a robust israeli left and a massive network of peace activists who continuously advocate for a two-state solution and palestinian rights. even in the middle of a war, israelis protest their own government and hold leaders accountable. this internal democratic pressure is exactly what allows for the possibility of change.",

from its past actions we can judge what it may be expected to do in the future. attack on arab village a shocking example was their behavior in the arab village of deir yassin. this village, off the main roads and surrounded by jewish lands, had taken no part in the war, and had even fought off arab bands who wanted to use the village as their base. on april 9 (the new york times), terrorist bands attacked this peaceful village, which was not a military objective in the fighting, killed most of its inhabitants “240 men, women, and children” and kept a few of them alive to parade as captives through the streets of jerusalem. most of the jewish community was horrified at the deed, and the jewish agency sent a telegram of apology to king abdullah of trans-jordan. but the terrorists, far from being ashamed of their act, were proud of this massacre, publicized it widely, and invited all the foreign correspondents present in the country to view the heaped corpses and the general havoc at deir yassin. the deir yassin incident exemplifies the character and actions of the freedom party. within the jewish community they have preached an admixture of ultranationalism, religious mysticism, and racial superiority. like other fascist parties they have been used to break strikes, and have themselves pressed for the destruction of free trade unions. in their stead they have proposed corporate unions on the italian fascist model. during the last years of sporadic anti-british violence, the izl and stern groups inaugurated a reign of terror in the palestine jewish community. teachers were beaten up for speaking against them, adults were shot for not letting their children join them. by gangster methods, beatings, window-smashing, and wide-spread robberies, the terrorists intimidated the population and exacted a heavy tribute. the people of the freedom party have had no part in the constructive achievements in palestine. they have reclaimed no land, built no settlements, and only detracted from the jewish defense activity. their much-publicized immigration endeavors were minute, and devoted mainly to bringing in fascist compatriots. discrepancies seen the discrepancies between the bold claims now being made by begin and his party, and their record of past performance in palestine bear the imprint of no ordinary political party. this is the unmistakable stamp of a fascist party for whom terrorism (against jews, arabs, and british alike), and misrepresentation are means, and a “leader state” is the goal. in the light of the foregoing considerations, it is imperative that the truth about mr. begin and his movement be made known in this country. it is all the more tragic that the top leadership of american zionism has refused to campaign against begin’s efforts, or even to expose to its own constituents the dangers to israel from support to begin. the undersigned therefore take this means of publicly presenting a few salient facts concerning begin and his party; and of urging all concerned not to support this latest manifestation of fascism.

(look up puritanism, pietism, millininearism, dispensationalism, and of course evangelicalism) --- re: 1. this is a strawman argument. jews have ties to palestine. palestinians have ties to palestine. people with cultural and historic ties to a land can argue they should live in that land. i have no problem with that. i have a problem with how that aim was achieved by the dispossession and disenfranchisement of another people. the ethnic cleansing of 750,000 palestinians from their homes. and a continued denial of their right to live in the land they have ties to. re:2. i fundamentally disagree with your framing. all the way from the second aliyah in 1904-14, palestinians were aware that some nation building was taking place. hence the prominent christian arab anti-zionist publications falastin and al-karmil in 1910s. furthermore, the hassan mcmahon correspondence of 1915-16 and the balfour declaration of 1917 upset many palestinians. add to that land purchases from absentee landlords, jewish-only labor in settlements and you have a recipe for resentment. it is in this context that some palestinians resorted to violent protests in 1920s. i do not excuse any attacks on civilians, and i readily condemn any such acts. my criticism is in the systemic, premeditated violence perpetrated by irgun, haganah, stern militias under the comicity of the jewish executive on a scale that left 750,000 palestinians homeless and stateless. any argument that justifies vilification of a whole people and excuses their suffering is calling for collective punishment, which is inherently reprehensible. you are doing that with arabs, and others do that with jews.",

(not that every choice israeli leaders made was perfect; far from it.). but let’s give up the fiction that arabs were just sitting around minding their own business when suddenly the jews came in and drove them off.",

(it also recommended an economic union and an international jerusalem). it was boycotted by the arab higher committee for being based on unjust premises. so it wasn't really a paragon of self-determination. it was hobbled when the us representative recommended peacekeeping operations instead of enforcing the partition plan in feb '48. even before the british withdrawal, the zionist paramilitaries had started cleansing operations. for example, plan dalet was finalized in march of 1948. the arab coalition, vastly outnumbered by the zionists, only entered palestine after the declaration of independence. i didnt say any of that in your second paragraph.",

        "clean_comment": "on the spectrum of us politics, i'm more left-leaning. but i certainly trend further right in discussing the conflict, and i think the way that happens is illustrative to many aspects of the conflict itself. contextually, the historical positions at various ends of the spectrum have developed and moved (and pushed people) a great deal over time. it was fairly easy to be a classic liberal in favor of world peace and a stable international order, including the 2ss process, in the 1990s. but the peace process got us nowhere, and withdrawal from gaza got us 20 years of hamas. as for the worst rhetoric, i mean, the same comes from 'your' side, both from the actual muslims, who are deeply right wing, and call openly and proudly for genocide of jews every time they open their mouths, to their allies on the left, who seem to have little problem un-masking and marching to slogans like 'gas the jews.' i don't think palestinians are fake, but i'm not sure that their identity is special in any way various other ethnic identities in the region or the entire world isn't, that it means they have more rights to not just a state, but all the land they want, in exclusion of other people. why do they deserve more than the kurds? or the catalonians? and while there is racist islamophobia, islamophobia has also clearly become a default go-to shield to excuse the obvious and open horrors of global islamic society. i can reject both, call a duck a duck, and call the violent, sexist, homophobic, racial-and-religious supremacists extremists in charge of every sharia society across the planet the primitive chuds and threats to the human race that they are. ultimately, i consider that my movement hasn't been from the left to the right, but from idealist to realist. going back to gaza, pulling out got 20 years of increased violence of the worst kinds. land for peace is disproven. we've now basically reset to square one. at that point, is it logical to try and do the same thing again? do you expect the outcome to be different the 2nd time around? or do you admit that the assumptions of the peace process in that era were probably flawed, and you have to look at different more realistic solutions.",

(that's a sensible take). --- einstein's discourse on zionism is as a means to right the wrongs done to jews in europe and to demand their own homeland as others had. i think it notably lacks mention of the injustices that were to be done and later done to the palestinians. that's important because those injustices, known globally in retrospect, are the core of the palestinian issue. his statements are not egregious or unexpected. he was neither a decision-maker in the world zionist congress jewish agency in palestine, nor on the ground in palestine to see the events unfold. he just wanted justice for his people.",
