those not completely devastated had been used as hen houses and stables filled with dung-heaps, garbage. and carcasses. the revered jewish graveyard on the mount of olives was in complete disarray with thousands of tombstones broken, some of which were used as building materials for roads and latrines. large areas of the cemetery were leveled to provide a short-cut to a new hotel. hundreds of torah scrolls and thousands of holy books were plundered and burned to ashes*\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mount_of_olives\n\n*some arab residents uprooted tombstones and plowed the land in the cemeteries, and an estimated 38,000 tombstones were damaged in total. during this period, a road was paved through the cemetery, in the process destroying graves including those of famous persons. in 1964, the intercontinental hotel was built at the summit of the mount. graves were also demolished for parking lots and a filling station and were used in latrines at a jordanian army barracks*\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_jewish_cemetery,_hebron\n\n*during the jordanian period (1948–1967), the cemetery was intentionally destroyed and the site was cultivated by arab residents for growing produce. around 4,000 tombstones were removed and used for construction purposes*\n\n\n.\n\ndirect quotes from fawzi al-qawuqji memoirs..\n\n\"*these reports also indicated that the fires caused by our bombardment of jewish installations had burnt down many of their provision stores, that the jews were in utter despair*\"\n\n\"*the jewish areas depended entirely on water from the ras al-ain position, while the arabs could use the wells in the old city. i therefore cabled to captain madlul abbas, the commander of the hattin battalion, telling him without delay to cut off the water at the springs, which were in his area.*\"",

my assumption (which is why i am a fervent proponent of a state, even though it is now linked to partition) is that a jewish state on only part of the land is not the end but the beginning. this is because this increase in possession is of consequence not only in itself, but because through it we increase our strength, and **every increase in strength helps in the possession of the land as a whole.** the establishment of a state, even if only on a portion of the land, is the maximal reinforcement of our strength at the present time and a powerful boost to our historical endeavors to liberate the entire country.\" \\9\\  \n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937\\_ben-gurion\\_letter(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937_ben-gurion_letter))\n\nyou go over a portion of this letter in your post so it's strange you didn't actually examine it in its totality, as you were complaining about others not doing.\n\n...\n\n\"weizmann and ben-gurion pressed for a solution based on partition. said weizmann: 'the jews would be fools not to accept it, even if \\the land they were allocated\\ were the size of a table cloth.' both saw partition as a stepping stone to further expansion and the eventual takeover of the whole of palestine. **'no zionist can forgo the smallest portion of the land of israel,'** ben-gurion was quoted as saying.\"  \n(https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr\\_0/page/138/mode/2up?q=stepping+stone(https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr_0/page/138/mode/2up?q=stepping+stone))\n\n...\n\n\"it might be noted that the “boundaries of zionist aspirations” in ben gurion’s “vision” were quite broad, including southern lebanon, southern syria, today’s jordan, all of cis-jordan, and the sinai. this was, in fact, one of ben-gurion’s constant themes. in internal discussion in 1938, he stated that **“after we become a strong force, as the result of the creation of a state, we shall abolish partition and expand to the whole of palestine. the state will only be a stage in the realization of zionism and its task is to prepare the ground for our expansion into the whole of palestine by a jewish-arab agreement. the state will have to preserve order not only by preaching morality but by machine guns, if necessary.”**\n\nthe “agreement” that ben-gurion had in mind was to be with king abdullah of jordan, who would be induced to cede areas of cis-jordan under his control, while many of the arab residents would leave. earlier, **ben-gurion had explained to arab interlocutors that “our land” included transjordan, and that it extended from the sinai to “the source of the jordan.”** in internal discussion he urged that “we do not suggest now to announce the final aim,” which is “far-reaching,” even more so than the aim of those who were opposing partition. “i am unwilling to abandon the great jewish vision, the final vision,” he added. this vision, here unspecified in scale, “is an organic, spiritual and ideological component of my jewishness and my zionist aspiration,” ben-gurion explained.\"  \n(https://archive.org/details/noamchomskyfatefultrianglef/page/n287/mode/2up(https://archive.org/details/noamchomskyfatefultrianglef/page/n287/mode/2up))\n\n...\n\n\"although the jewish agency accepted the partition plan, it did not accept the proposed borders as final and israel's declaration of independence avoided the mention of any boundaries. a state in part of palestine was seen as a stage towards a larger state when opportunity allowed. although the borders were “bad from a military and political point of view,” **ben gurion urged fellow jews to accept the un partition plan, pointing out that arrangements are never final, “not with regard to the regime, not with regard to borders, and not with regard to international agreements.”**\n\nthe idea of partition being a temporary expedient dated back to the peel partition proposal of 1937. when the zionist congress had rejected partition on the grounds that the jews had an inalienable right to settle anywhere in palestine, **ben gurion had argued in favour of acceptance: “i see in the realisation of this plan practically the decisive stage in the beginning of full redemption and the most wonderful lever for the gradual conquest of all of palestine.”**  \n(https://archive.org/details/palestineisraelu0000mcdo/mode/2up?q=full+redemption(https://archive.org/details/palestineisraelu0000mcdo/mode/2up?q=full+redemption))\n\n“after the formation of a large army in the wake of the establishment of the state, we will abolish partition and expand to the whole of palestine.”  \n— ben gurion, p. 22, *the birth of israel* (1987), simha flapan.\n\n“if it was permissible to move an arab from the galilee to judea, why it is impossible to move an arab from hebron to transjordan, which is much closer? there are vast expanses of land there and we are overcrowded. even the high commission agrees to a transfer to transjordan if we equip the peasants with land and money. if the peel commission and the london government accept, we’ll remove the land problem from the agenda.”",

(the acropolis style temples at leveled mountaintops shimmering in the clouds caused ancient people even including visitors from greece and rome to become speechless in awe.).\n\nalso (and this has always puzzled me and been one of the things that personally attached me most to the jewish people, judaism and zionism), where are the hittites?  the edomites?  the phonicuans?   (hat tip to samaritans, they’re still extant).",

        "clean_comment": "i think you meant a 3 state solution, you forgot jordan. i don't see any benefit in there for israel, so why would they go for that plan ? gaza is almost pacified so give it another year maybe and they'll be completely disarmed. send in the wheel excavators and they could have the ground scrubbed of unexploded munitions and tunnels in less than another year. start with a nice flat clean slate and some nice new tents, eliminate the antagonists like the un and hamas and gaza, in a generation or so might be ready for an easing of restrictions, who knows, i guess it depends on them if they want to live in peace or not. \n\ngiving up the settlements isn't going to happen, again nothing in it for israel. asking israel to pay reparations is nuts, they didn't start it, speaking of which, the israeli's are still owed reparations from when they were thrown out of all those arab nations, and particularly in the west bank by jordan and in the old trans-jordon. in the end reparations work out more in favor of israel than the arabs in the mandate area. again, nothing in it for israel. \n\nmy two cents is that plan would never work. i think a better plan would be for gaza to voluntarily disarm immediately and peacefully evacuate all areas behind the yellow line as penance for the atrocities of 10/7. surrender all hamas members to the israeli army within 30 days or face consequences. \n\nthe west bank is a whole other can of worms. \n\nanyway its great that folks are trying to come up with solutions but its got to be equitable and it must take into consideration that israel has been forced to defend itself from day one and has no reason to lift restrictions. trust is something you gain over time and so far its been one terrorist act after another so, israel has no incentive to lift restrictions. \n\nmy two cents   \ncheers.",

(that's a sensible take).\n\n---\n\neinstein's discourse on zionism is as a means to right the wrongs done to jews in europe and to demand their own homeland as others had. i think it notably lacks mention of the injustices that were to be done and later done to the palestinians. that's important because those injustices, known globally in retrospect, are the core of the palestinian issue.\n\nhis statements are not egregious or unexpected. he was neither a decision-maker in the world zionist congress / jewish agency in palestine, nor on the ground in palestine to see the events unfold. he just wanted justice for his people.",

(both war crimes)\n4. israel tries to navigate the thus created highly chaotic urban warzone, by letting people evacuate, but is shot at from non combat zones from sniper or rocket launcher spots, which nearly always happen to sit on top of homes, hospitals, schools, etc.\n5. israel bombs the thus created military infrastructure (look at rules for international warfare) to protect their soldiers.\n6. hamas publishes horrifying videos of the children israel supposedly killed on purpose, by bombing a house or school, conveniently leaving out step 1-5.\n7. people in the west that have no clue about war zones and their rules start rioting.\n\nnot to say, that the likud isn’t a party of racist a-holes that need to go down, or that there aren’t racists in the idf that use their power to torment and unnecessarily kill palestinian civilians. or that the slow land grabbing in the west bank shouldn’t stop. but i highly doubt that any of the people protesting even have the hint of an idea, how many of those civilian deaths are actually due to hamas war tactics, that are specifically designed to get their own people killed as martyrs and their deaths used as war propaganda in the west. a tactic that seems to work, looking at the amount of help money that hamas related organizations in western countries have already funneled directly to hamas before they were uncovered. if hamas was a normal government that fought to protect their citizens and provided shelter in bunkers for the civilians, the numbers of deaths would be a clearer sign of intend. since that is not the case, the sole number of supposedly civilians dying (which is also provided by hamas) is not really telling us anything except the tragedy of loss of human lives. but not deliberate “slaughter” by israelis.",

(look up puritanism, pietism, millininearism, dispensationalism, and of course evangelicalism)\n\n---\n\nre: 1. this is a strawman argument. jews have ties to palestine. palestinians have ties to palestine. people with cultural and historic ties to a land can argue they should live in that land. i have no problem with that. i have a problem with how that aim was achieved by the dispossession and disenfranchisement of another people. the ethnic cleansing of 750,000 palestinians from their homes. and a continued denial of their right to live in the land they have ties to.\n\nre:2. i fundamentally disagree with your framing. all the way from the second aliyah in 1904-14, palestinians were aware that some nation building was taking place. hence the prominent christian arab anti-zionist publications falastin and al-karmil in 1910s. furthermore, the hassan mcmahon correspondence of 1915-16 and the balfour declaration of 1917 upset many palestinians. add to that land purchases from absentee landlords, jewish-only labor in settlements and you have a recipe for resentment.  it is in this context that some palestinians resorted to violent protests in 1920s. i do not excuse any attacks on civilians, and i readily condemn any such acts. my criticism is in the *systemic*, *premeditated* violence perpetrated by irgun, haganah, stern militias under the comicity of the jewish executive on a scale that left 750,000 palestinians homeless and stateless.\n\nany argument that justifies vilification of a whole people and excuses their suffering is calling for collective punishment, which is inherently reprehensible. you are doing that with arabs, and others do that with jews.",

        "clean_comment": "i appreciate you sharing your perspective as a european observer. it’s a complex situation, but to have a truly balanced conversation, there are several factual and legal points that need to be cleared up regarding the claims you’ve made.\n\nfirst, it is a common misconception that arab-israeli citizens (who make up about 21% of the population) have inferior legal status. under israeli law, they have full and equal rights: they vote in every election, hold seats in the knesset (parliament), and serve as judges on the supreme court. in fact, an arab party was part of the governing coalition recently. while there are certainly socioeconomic disparities and historical tensions - much like minority populations face in europe - it is inaccurate to say they lack the same rights as jewish citizens.\n\nregarding the idea that 10/7 was a protest that turned into ‘chaos’ or that atrocities were ‘propaganda’: multiple international bodies, including the un and human rights watch, have documented that the attacks involved systematic massacres, torture, sexual violence, and kidnapping. captured documents and body-cam footage from the attackers themselves showed that the targeting of civilians was not an accident, but a pre-planned objective with specific maps of civilian communities.\n\nyou asked why the division didn’t happen.\nit’s important to note that israel has agreed to a two-state solution multiple times, as op mentioned. beyond the 1947 partition, israel made significant offers in the oslo accords, camp david summits, and the 2008 olmert plan, which would have seen the creation of a palestinian state on nearly all of the west bank and gaza. these offers were rejected by palestinian leadership.\n\nregarding the us 20-point plan you mentioned- that framework actually requires the complete demilitarization of gaza and the removal of hamas from power to ensure safety for both sides. it would require both leaderships to protect their civilians, something hamas failed to do by using civilian infrastructure for military purposes.\n\nfinally, i’m not sure if you realize that israel is a self-critical democracy. there is a robust israeli left and a massive network of peace activists who continuously advocate for a two-state solution and palestinian rights. even in the middle of a war, israelis protest their own government and hold leaders accountable. this internal democratic pressure is exactly what allows for the possibility of change.",

        "clean_comment": "again, both sides violated international law in various ways. the palestinian violations are more severe, more blatant, and more systematic. with essentially no attempt whatsoever to follow international law, nothing that comes even close to the israeli attempts to do so (however deficient you mind find them). and if anything, the palestinians have a longstanding strategic policy to completely flaunt any obligations they might have under ihl (and international law period), only taking note of ihl when they intentionally abuse it, and this policy forms the core of their military strategy.  and when talking about the recent gaza conflict, the palestinian criminal choices are the main driving force behind the suffering and death inflicted on both gazans and israelis. so again, trying to take op's argument about the \"middle road\", and swerving hard into \"israel is evil\", *especially* if you justify it with \"no middle road when it comes to legal obligations\", is just not justifiable or \"serious\", on any level.\n\nas for the second paragraph, what's fundamentally \"unserious\" is your engagement with my argument, or rather, refusal to engage with it. if hamas didn't start this illegal war of aggression, and didn't illegally enmesh themselves within their civilian population, considerations like the proportionality of strikes on civilian objects wouldn't even come into play. once the palestinians did make that set of intentional, fundamental criminal choices, it's not impossible, but certainly much, much harder for israel to pursue their legitimate war aims legally. and it's basically impossible for them to do so, without people like you simply declaring any attack that \"foreseeably killed civilians\" is automatically disproportional, a war crime, and possibly even equivalent to the widespread and systematic palestinian practice of intentionally targeting civilians, based on the little skewed information they get from the media.\n\nthat's not a coincidence. that's literally the point. the reason why hamas invested so much effort and money into their criminal strategy of human shielding and perfidy.  you don't get to ignore that, and wave it off with \"who cares, let's talk about israeli legal obligations instead\".",

from its past actions we can judge what it may be expected to do in the future.       \n\nattack on arab village      \n\na shocking example was their behavior in the arab village of deir yassin. this village, off the main roads and surrounded by jewish lands, had taken no part in the war, and had even fought off arab bands who wanted to use the village as their base. on april 9 (the new york times), terrorist bands attacked this peaceful village, which was not a military objective in the fighting, killed most of its inhabitants “240 men, women, and children” and kept a few of them alive to parade as captives through the streets of jerusalem. most of the jewish community was horrified at the deed, and the jewish agency sent a telegram of apology to king abdullah of trans-jordan. but the terrorists, far from being ashamed of their act, were proud of this massacre, publicized it widely, and invited all the foreign correspondents present in the country to view the heaped corpses and the general havoc at deir yassin.       \n\nthe deir yassin incident exemplifies the character and actions of the freedom party.       \n\nwithin the jewish community they have preached an admixture of ultranationalism, religious mysticism, and racial superiority. like other fascist parties they have been used to break strikes, and have themselves pressed for the destruction of free trade unions. in their stead they have proposed corporate unions on the italian fascist model.      \n\nduring the last years of sporadic anti-british violence, the izl and stern groups inaugurated a reign of terror in the palestine jewish community. teachers were beaten up for speaking against them, adults were shot for not letting their children join them. by gangster methods, beatings, window-smashing, and wide-spread robberies, the terrorists intimidated the population and exacted a heavy tribute.      \n\nthe people of the freedom party have had no part in the constructive achievements in palestine. they have reclaimed no land, built no settlements, and only detracted from the jewish defense activity. their much-publicized immigration endeavors were minute, and devoted mainly to bringing in fascist compatriots.      \n\ndiscrepancies seen      \n\nthe discrepancies between the bold claims now being made by begin and his party, and their record of past performance in palestine bear the imprint of no ordinary political party. this is the unmistakable stamp of a fascist party for whom terrorism (against jews, arabs, and british alike), and misrepresentation are means, and a “leader state” is the goal.      \n\nin the light of the foregoing considerations, it is imperative that the truth about mr. begin and his movement be made known in this country. it is all the more tragic that the top leadership of american zionism has refused to campaign against begin’s efforts, or even to expose to its own constituents the dangers to israel from support to begin.     \n\nthe undersigned therefore take this means of publicly presenting a few salient facts concerning begin and his party; and of urging all concerned not to support this latest manifestation of fascism.       \n\n(signed)\n\nisidore abramowitz, hannah arendt, abraham brick, rabbi jessurun cardozo, albert einstein, herman eisen, m.d., hayim fineman, m. gallen, m.d., h.h. harris, zelig s. harris, sidney hook, fred karush, bruria kaufman, irma l. lindheim, nachman maisel, symour melman, myer d. mendelson, m.d., harry m. orlinsky, samuel pitlick, fritz rohrlich, louis p. rocker, ruth sager, itzhak sankowsky, i.j. schoenberg, samuel shuman, m. znger, irma wolpe, stefan wolpe",

those not completely devastated had been used as hen houses and stables filled with dung-heaps, garbage. and carcasses. the revered jewish graveyard on the mount of olives was in complete disarray with thousands of tombstones broken, some of which were used as building materials for roads and latrines. large areas of the cemetery were leveled to provide a short-cut to a new hotel. hundreds of torah scrolls and thousands of holy books were plundered and burned to ashes*\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mount_of_olives\n\n*some arab residents uprooted tombstones and plowed the land in the cemeteries, and an estimated 38,000 tombstones were damaged in total. during this period, a road was paved through the cemetery, in the process destroying graves including those of famous persons. in 1964, the intercontinental hotel was built at the summit of the mount. graves were also demolished for parking lots and a filling station and were used in latrines at a jordanian army barracks*\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_jewish_cemetery,_hebron\n\n*during the jordanian period (1948–1967), the cemetery was intentionally destroyed and the site was cultivated by arab residents for growing produce. around 4,000 tombstones were removed and used for construction purposes*\n\n\n.\n\ndirect quotes from fawzi al-qawuqji memoirs..\n\n\"*these reports also indicated that the fires caused by our bombardment of jewish installations had burnt down many of their provision stores, that the jews were in utter despair*\"\n\n\"*the jewish areas depended entirely on water from the ras al-ain position, while the arabs could use the wells in the old city. i therefore cabled to captain madlul abbas, the commander of the hattin battalion, telling him without delay to cut off the water at the springs, which were in his area.*\"",

my assumption (which is why i am a fervent proponent of a state, even though it is now linked to partition) is that a jewish state on only part of the land is not the end but the beginning. this is because this increase in possession is of consequence not only in itself, but because through it we increase our strength, and **every increase in strength helps in the possession of the land as a whole.** the establishment of a state, even if only on a portion of the land, is the maximal reinforcement of our strength at the present time and a powerful boost to our historical endeavors to liberate the entire country.\" \\9\\  \n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937\\_ben-gurion\\_letter(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937_ben-gurion_letter))\n\nyou go over a portion of this letter in your post so it's strange you didn't actually examine it in its totality, as you were complaining about others not doing.\n\n...\n\n\"weizmann and ben-gurion pressed for a solution based on partition. said weizmann: 'the jews would be fools not to accept it, even if \\the land they were allocated\\ were the size of a table cloth.' both saw partition as a stepping stone to further expansion and the eventual takeover of the whole of palestine. **'no zionist can forgo the smallest portion of the land of israel,'** ben-gurion was quoted as saying.\"  \n(https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr\\_0/page/138/mode/2up?q=stepping+stone(https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr_0/page/138/mode/2up?q=stepping+stone))\n\n...\n\n\"it might be noted that the “boundaries of zionist aspirations” in ben gurion’s “vision” were quite broad, including southern lebanon, southern syria, today’s jordan, all of cis-jordan, and the sinai. this was, in fact, one of ben-gurion’s constant themes. in internal discussion in 1938, he stated that **“after we become a strong force, as the result of the creation of a state, we shall abolish partition and expand to the whole of palestine. the state will only be a stage in the realization of zionism and its task is to prepare the ground for our expansion into the whole of palestine by a jewish-arab agreement. the state will have to preserve order not only by preaching morality but by machine guns, if necessary.”**\n\nthe “agreement” that ben-gurion had in mind was to be with king abdullah of jordan, who would be induced to cede areas of cis-jordan under his control, while many of the arab residents would leave. earlier, **ben-gurion had explained to arab interlocutors that “our land” included transjordan, and that it extended from the sinai to “the source of the jordan.”** in internal discussion he urged that “we do not suggest now to announce the final aim,” which is “far-reaching,” even more so than the aim of those who were opposing partition. “i am unwilling to abandon the great jewish vision, the final vision,” he added. this vision, here unspecified in scale, “is an organic, spiritual and ideological component of my jewishness and my zionist aspiration,” ben-gurion explained.\"  \n(https://archive.org/details/noamchomskyfatefultrianglef/page/n287/mode/2up(https://archive.org/details/noamchomskyfatefultrianglef/page/n287/mode/2up))\n\n...\n\n\"although the jewish agency accepted the partition plan, it did not accept the proposed borders as final and israel's declaration of independence avoided the mention of any boundaries. a state in part of palestine was seen as a stage towards a larger state when opportunity allowed. although the borders were “bad from a military and political point of view,” **ben gurion urged fellow jews to accept the un partition plan, pointing out that arrangements are never final, “not with regard to the regime, not with regard to borders, and not with regard to international agreements.”**\n\nthe idea of partition being a temporary expedient dated back to the peel partition proposal of 1937. when the zionist congress had rejected partition on the grounds that the jews had an inalienable right to settle anywhere in palestine, **ben gurion had argued in favour of acceptance: “i see in the realisation of this plan practically the decisive stage in the beginning of full redemption and the most wonderful lever for the gradual conquest of all of palestine.”**  \n(https://archive.org/details/palestineisraelu0000mcdo/mode/2up?q=full+redemption(https://archive.org/details/palestineisraelu0000mcdo/mode/2up?q=full+redemption))\n\n“after the formation of a large army in the wake of the establishment of the state, we will abolish partition and expand to the whole of palestine.”  \n— ben gurion, p. 22, *the birth of israel* (1987), simha flapan.\n\n“if it was permissible to move an arab from the galilee to judea, why it is impossible to move an arab from hebron to transjordan, which is much closer? there are vast expanses of land there and we are overcrowded. even the high commission agrees to a transfer to transjordan if we equip the peasants with land and money. if the peel commission and the london government accept, we’ll remove the land problem from the agenda.”",

(the acropolis style temples at leveled mountaintops shimmering in the clouds caused ancient people even including visitors from greece and rome to become speechless in awe.).\n\nalso (and this has always puzzled me and been one of the things that personally attached me most to the jewish people, judaism and zionism), where are the hittites?  the edomites?  the phonicuans?

        "clean_comment": "i think you meant a 3 state solution, you forgot jordan. i don't see any benefit in there for israel, so why would they go for that plan ? gaza is almost pacified so give it another year maybe and they'll be completely disarmed. send in the wheel excavators and they could have the ground scrubbed of unexploded munitions and tunnels in less than another year. start with a nice flat clean slate and some nice new tents, eliminate the antagonists like the un and hamas and gaza, in a generation or so might be ready for an easing of restrictions, who knows, i guess it depends on them if they want to live in peace or not. \n\ngiving up the settlements isn't going to happen, again nothing in it for israel. asking israel to pay reparations is nuts, they didn't start it, speaking of which, the israeli's are still owed reparations from when they were thrown out of all those arab nations, and particularly in the west bank by jordan and in the old trans-jordon. in the end reparations work out more in favor of israel than the arabs in the mandate area. again, nothing in it for israel. \n\nmy two cents is that plan would never work. i think a better plan would be for gaza to voluntarily disarm immediately and peacefully evacuate all areas behind the yellow line as penance for the atrocities of 10/7. surrender all hamas members to the israeli army within 30 days or face consequences. \n\nthe west bank is a whole other can of worms. \n\nanyway its great that folks are trying to come up with solutions but its got to be equitable and it must take into consideration that israel has been forced to defend itself from day one and has no reason to lift restrictions. trust is something you gain over time and so far its been one terrorist act after another so, israel has no incentive to lift restrictions. \n\nmy two cents   \ncheers.",

(that's a sensible take).\n\n---\n\neinstein's discourse on zionism is as a means to right the wrongs done to jews in europe and to demand their own homeland as others had. i think it notably lacks mention of the injustices that were to be done and later done to the palestinians. that's important because those injustices, known globally in retrospect, are the core of the palestinian issue.\n\nhis statements are not egregious or unexpected. he was neither a decision-maker in the world zionist congress / jewish agency in palestine, nor on the ground in palestine to see the events unfold. he just wanted justice for his people.",

        "clean_comment": "you have quite a one-sided view of the conflict and seem to have accepted only the zionist framing.\n\n&gt;correct my statements if they are wrong as i am still learning about the war. from what i know, britain promised the region to the jews and the arabs at the same time, of course this will start a war\n\nkinda? britain committed itself to establish a jewish national home in palestine in 1917 with the balfour declaration. they also separately promised to support an independent arab state in exchange for arab support in defeating the ottoman empire. you could say that they are incompatible commitments, and in a way they are, but the important part is the actions that followed. \n\nafter 1917 britain worked with the zionist settlers to create quasi-state infrastructure in palestine for the zionists and brutally suppressed the palestinian opposition. so you can say they followed through on their commitment made in the balfour declaration. on the other hand, they did not follow through on their commitment to an independent arab state. they secretly agreed with france how the region should be split between them in the sykes picot agreement. \n\n&gt;how would that be israel’s fault for coming back to their ancestral homeland when the owner of the land tells you that you can have it?\n\nwell first because britain wasn't the 'owner of the land', it was a colonial power. and more importantly because there were already people living there. settlers coming to a place and demanding the natives leave so they can establish a state is still wrong whether or not the settlers view it as their ancestral homeland.   \n\n\n&gt;despite this israel tries to have a 2 state solution 4 different times. palestine denies it every time and starts wars with israel. israel wins every time and palestine loses land because of it. again i ask, how does that make israel the bad guy?\n\ni'm not sure what the 4 times you are referring to, but this is at best a very one sided way of presenting the history. after 1948, you have 750,000 palestinians who have been ethnically cleansed from their homes who are now stateless. since then, israel has prevented them from returning to their homes, and at the same time blocked any moves towards an independent, sovereign and viable palestinian state. in 1967, israel invaded and occupied more territory, including the west bank and east jerusalem, the latter of which is the centre of palestinian economic, religious and cultural life. it also fragmented the west bank into separate areas cut off from each other and surrounded by new israeli settlements, and cuts off gaza from the rest of palestine and the rest of the world more generally. \n\nso the primary opposition to israel these days tends to focus on the genocide in gaza (obviously), and the occupation and oppression of palestinians in the west bank and east jerusalem. \n\n&gt;in 2005 they give palestine gaza and what happens? hamas uses it to build miles of tunnels and send hundreds or thousands of missiles to israel. \n\nthis is a common misconception. israel withdrew its settlers and soldiers from gaza in 2005, but it didn't \"give palestine gaza\". it was still in effective control, so was still the occupying power according to international law and the leading international bodies. the leading expert on the political economy of gaza is sara roy of harvard, and her work showing how israel deliberately 'de-developed' gaza's economy during this period is required reading on this topic. \n\n&gt;what would you have done if you were israel?\n\nthe obvious answer is \"not commit a genocide\", but i will expand on that a little. the key point is to understand the underlying cause and work to address it. palestinian resistance has come in many forms, but at its heart its a fight against an occupying power who has expelled them from their homeland and rendered them a stateless people at the mercy of israeli occupation and aggression. the solution is to take the difficult steps necessary to end the occupation and work towards living in peace. end the siege on gaza and the illegal settlement expansion in the west bank, and give equal rights and freedoms to palestinians as israeli jews currently enjoy. it's a difficult process and it wouldn't solve everything overnight. but the current playbook is also untenable. it just reproduces a cycle of violence that will end with the extermination or expulsion of one group of people. we desperately need a new approach and new ideas, and that will take bravery and real leaders, not just politicians.",

(both war crimes)\n4. israel tries to navigate the thus created highly chaotic urban warzone, by letting people evacuate, but is shot at from non combat zones from sniper or rocket launcher spots, which nearly always happen to sit on top of homes, hospitals, schools, etc.\n5. israel bombs the thus created military infrastructure (look at rules for international warfare) to protect their soldiers.\n6. hamas publishes horrifying videos of the children israel supposedly killed on purpose, by bombing a house or school, conveniently leaving out step 1-5.\n7. people in the west that have no clue about war zones and their rules start rioting.\n\nnot to say, that the likud isn’t a party of racist a-holes that need to go down, or that there aren’t racists in the idf that use their power to torment and unnecessarily kill palestinian civilians. or that the slow land grabbing in the west bank shouldn’t stop. but i highly doubt that any of the people protesting even have the hint of an idea, how many of those civilian deaths are actually due to hamas war tactics, that are specifically designed to get their own people killed as martyrs and their deaths used as war propaganda in the west. a tactic that seems to work, looking at the amount of help money that hamas related organizations in western countries have already funneled directly to hamas before they were uncovered. if hamas was a normal government that fought to protect their citizens and provided shelter in bunkers for the civilians, the numbers of deaths would be a clearer sign of intend. since that is not the case, the sole number of supposedly civilians dying (which is also provided by hamas) is not really telling us anything except the tragedy of loss of human lives. but not deliberate “slaughter” by israelis.",

(look up puritanism, pietism, millininearism, dispensationalism, and of course evangelicalism)\n\n---\n\nre: 1. this is a strawman argument. jews have ties to palestine. palestinians have ties to palestine. people with cultural and historic ties to a land can argue they should live in that land. i have no problem with that. i have a problem with how that aim was achieved by the dispossession and disenfranchisement of another people. the ethnic cleansing of 750,000 palestinians from their homes. and a continued denial of their right to live in the land they have ties to.\n\nre:2. i fundamentally disagree with your framing. all the way from the second aliyah in 1904-14, palestinians were aware that some nation building was taking place. hence the prominent christian arab anti-zionist publications falastin and al-karmil in 1910s. furthermore, the hassan mcmahon correspondence of 1915-16 and the balfour declaration of 1917 upset many palestinians. add to that land purchases from absentee landlords, jewish-only labor in settlements and you have a recipe for resentment.  it is in this context that some palestinians resorted to violent protests in 1920s. i do not excuse any attacks on civilians, and i readily condemn any such acts. my criticism is in the *systemic*, *premeditated* violence perpetrated by irgun, haganah, stern militias under the comicity of the jewish executive on a scale that left 750,000 palestinians homeless and stateless.\n\nany argument that justifies vilification of a whole people and excuses their suffering is calling for collective punishment, which is inherently reprehensible. you are doing that with arabs, and others do that with jews.",

        "clean_comment": "i appreciate you sharing your perspective as a european observer. it’s a complex situation, but to have a truly balanced conversation, there are several factual and legal points that need to be cleared up regarding the claims you’ve made.\n\nfirst, it is a common misconception that arab-israeli citizens (who make up about 21% of the population) have inferior legal status. under israeli law, they have full and equal rights: they vote in every election, hold seats in the knesset (parliament), and serve as judges on the supreme court. in fact, an arab party was part of the governing coalition recently. while there are certainly socioeconomic disparities and historical tensions - much like minority populations face in europe - it is inaccurate to say they lack the same rights as jewish citizens.\n\nregarding the idea that 10/7 was a protest that turned into ‘chaos’ or that atrocities were ‘propaganda’: multiple international bodies, including the un and human rights watch, have documented that the attacks involved systematic massacres, torture, sexual violence, and kidnapping. captured documents and body-cam footage from the attackers themselves showed that the targeting of civilians was not an accident, but a pre-planned objective with specific maps of civilian communities.\n\nyou asked why the division didn’t happen.\nit’s important to note that israel has agreed to a two-state solution multiple times, as op mentioned. beyond the 1947 partition, israel made significant offers in the oslo accords, camp david summits, and the 2008 olmert plan, which would have seen the creation of a palestinian state on nearly all of the west bank and gaza. these offers were rejected by palestinian leadership.\n\nregarding the us 20-point plan you mentioned- that framework actually requires the complete demilitarization of gaza and the removal of hamas from power to ensure safety for both sides. it would require both leaderships to protect their civilians, something hamas failed to do by using civilian infrastructure for military purposes.\n\nfinally, i’m not sure if you realize that israel is a self-critical democracy. there is a robust israeli left and a massive network of peace activists who continuously advocate for a two-state solution and palestinian rights. even in the middle of a war, israelis protest their own government and hold leaders accountable. this internal democratic pressure is exactly what allows for the possibility of change.",

        "clean_comment": "you are working off a pretty distorted caricature of christian zionism *that honestly sounds more like anti-zionist propaganda* than anything you'd actually find in mainstream evangelical theology, and for someone whose people have been perpetual victims of libels for centuries (if not millennia), you should probably be more careful about repeating libels against others. i've never encountered any serious christian zionist teacher or book claiming that jews need to gather in israel so they can all die horribly while christians get raptured to heaven, and honestly that's such a cartoonish misrepresentation that it makes me wonder where you even got this idea from because it sure wasn't from actually reading what these people believe. the actual theological framework most christian zionists work from comes straight out of the tanakh (books like zechariah and ezekiel written by *your* prophets) which prophesy that in the last days israel will be restored, attacked by nations, and then god will personally intervene to defend them and judge the world based on how they treated the jewish people, and plenty of christians also draw on their own scriptures which predict that *christians* (not jews) will face severe persecution before christ returns, so if anything the shoe's on the other foot regarding who's supposedly dying horribly.\n\nyou're also confusing the rapture with the second coming which suggests you don't actually understand the eschatological framework you're critiquing, and not even all christian zionists believe in a pre-tribulation rapture anyway so you're attacking a position that isn't even universally held among the group you're criticizing. what's really going on here is that many christians support israel for the same reasons other westerners do (shared democratic values, common threats, cultural affinity) and yes some *also* have theological reasons rooted in believing that god's covenantal promises to the jewish people still stand, but reducing that to \"they want us all dead so they can go to heaven\" is exactly the kind of bad faith misrepresentation that anti-zionists use to drive wedges between israel and one of its most reliable support bases. you can disagree with christian eschatology all you want but at least represent what people actually believe before you call them creepy, because right now you're essentially repeating talking points designed by people who want to isolate israel by convincing jews that their christian allies are secretly hoping for their destruction, which is both factually wrong and strategically foolish.",

from its past actions we can judge what it may be expected to do in the future.       \n\nattack on arab village      \n\na shocking example was their behavior in the arab village of deir yassin. this village, off the main roads and surrounded by jewish lands, had taken no part in the war, and had even fought off arab bands who wanted to use the village as their base. on april 9 (the new york times), terrorist bands attacked this peaceful village, which was not a military objective in the fighting, killed most of its inhabitants “240 men, women, and children” and kept a few of them alive to parade as captives through the streets of jerusalem. most of the jewish community was horrified at the deed, and the jewish agency sent a telegram of apology to king abdullah of trans-jordan. but the terrorists, far from being ashamed of their act, were proud of this massacre, publicized it widely, and invited all the foreign correspondents present in the country to view the heaped corpses and the general havoc at deir yassin.       \n\nthe deir yassin incident exemplifies the character and actions of the freedom party.       \n\nwithin the jewish community they have preached an admixture of ultranationalism, religious mysticism, and racial superiority. like other fascist parties they have been used to break strikes, and have themselves pressed for the destruction of free trade unions. in their stead they have proposed corporate unions on the italian fascist model.      \n\nduring the last years of sporadic anti-british violence, the izl and stern groups inaugurated a reign of terror in the palestine jewish community. teachers were beaten up for speaking against them, adults were shot for not letting their children join them. by gangster methods, beatings, window-smashing, and wide-spread robberies, the terrorists intimidated the population and exacted a heavy tribute.      \n\nthe people of the freedom party have had no part in the constructive achievements in palestine. they have reclaimed no land, built no settlements, and only detracted from the jewish defense activity. their much-publicized immigration endeavors were minute, and devoted mainly to bringing in fascist compatriots.      \n\ndiscrepancies seen      \n\nthe discrepancies between the bold claims now being made by begin and his party, and their record of past performance in palestine bear the imprint of no ordinary political party. this is the unmistakable stamp of a fascist party for whom terrorism (against jews, arabs, and british alike), and misrepresentation are means, and a “leader state” is the goal.      \n\nin the light of the foregoing considerations, it is imperative that the truth about mr. begin and his movement be made known in this country. it is all the more tragic that the top leadership of american zionism has refused to campaign against begin’s efforts, or even to expose to its own constituents the dangers to israel from support to begin.     \n\nthe undersigned therefore take this means of publicly presenting a few salient facts concerning begin and his party; and of urging all concerned not to support this latest manifestation of fascism.       \n\n(signed)\n\nisidore abramowitz, hannah arendt, abraham brick, rabbi jessurun cardozo, albert einstein, herman eisen, m.d., hayim fineman, m. gallen, m.d., h.h. harris, zelig s. harris, sidney hook, fred karush, bruria kaufman, irma l. lindheim, nachman maisel, symour melman, myer d. mendelson, m.d., harry m. orlinsky, samuel pitlick, fritz rohrlich, louis p. rocker, ruth sager, itzhak sankowsky, i.j. schoenberg, samuel shuman, m. znger, irma wolpe, stefan wolpe",
