You’ve seen these pictures of people cutting open the chest of an enemy, these Islamists, tearing out the heart. The person is still alive and eating the heart.” The reality, he argues, is that “Israel is defending itself, but in so doing, we’re defending Western civilisation.”\n\n\nHow is this not like the Jewish blood libel?

Zionism is using Judaism and is the biggest threat to it. Jews have lived in Palestine forever but it doesn't mean 5% turns into half a country. It's almost as if America and the West closed their doors purposely so all these refugees would go to Palestine. The problem was always European and should've been solved in Europe. This doesn't mean Jews can't live in Palestine. They are welcome and we're welcomed until the plans for Zionism were found. And you can't just build a country on top of another. No one is worth more than others. We are all equal. We haven't been there for generations. We have been there since the times of Canaan and most of us also have Israelite blood. It doesn't mean we could do the same if the roles were reversed. It's a shame because Palestinians didn't have a problems with Jews and actually welcomed them even before and after the Holocaust. Religion is sacred here and it's sacred because all must live together. Zionism was never about that. It was an atheist movement for Ashkenazim before the Holocaust ever happened. It was colonial and used self proclaimed terrorist groups like the Lehi, Stern, Hagana etc. who eventually became the Iof and government. This movement hijacked all religions because it had no respect for any including Judaism.",

I guess as a fellaha it allowed her to reuse the tatreez on a new dress should the fabric of the original be worn out or if she grew bigger. And I think she did that for a few decades because on some parts, the embroidery is very worn out, meanwhile the fabric of the dress was fine.  I was gifted her thobes after her passing away. As she was a heavy woman and I could never wear her thobes, I just had to unsew the pieces of embroidery. I have yet to resew the piece on a dress my size, but that might be a strategy that you want to explore too.",

It was just Jordanian territory. In 1967 Jordan joined a war against Israel and they lost. Israel took control of the territory because of that.\n\nWhen a nation starts a war and loses they often lose territory. This is a standard outcome of conflict throughout history.\n\nTake the Mexican-American War as an example. A significant portion of the current United States was Mexican territory. Mexico lost that land in a war. We do not look at a map today and say \"the US is occupying California\" or that they \"stole it from Mexico\". We acknowledge that borders shift as a result of wars.\n\nJordan eventually renounced its claims to the West Bank in 1988. So the narrative that this land was stolen ignores reality. It was captured in a defensive war from a country that had previously occupied it and lost.\n\nAt best any Jordanians (\"Palestinians) left in that region should move back to Jordan since that is the country who lost the land.",

That was the the principal source of rising support for the Palestinians and rising hostility to Israel's tactics. \n\nHowever, the doesn't mean there's been been some dramatic re-evaluation of the Palestinian cause more generally. With respect to the Palestinians, most people, 1) don't care, 2) care, but not enough to get off the couch, 3) don't understand the issues involved, or 4) think the Palestinians deserve at least some of what they get. \n\nThose on the hard left -- or in the developing world or in the Muslim world -- who are fervent supporters of Palestinian rights (and there are a lot of them, no doubt) are about to experience a whole lot of disappointment. They misinterpret public sentiment. Things will almost certainly return to the status quo ante very shortly, and then we'll all go through exactly the same thing we just went through 25 years from now, and then 25 years after that, and so on. Globally, most people understand intuitively that the Middle East is a nexus of problems and issues that will never be solved. It's the same reason people in the West never got too wound up about all the killing in Syria, in Iraq, or wherever. They know that's the nature of the Middle East and they know it will never end. They don't want to be too involved in it or connected to it, and they want to forget about it as soon as they're humanly able. \n\nSo anybody who thinks there's been some dramatic shift that means \"liberation\" for the Palestinians is at hand, I would suggest that that's very, very unlikely. People in the West just don't care enough, and people in the rest of the world don't have the ability to effect the sort of change supporters of the Palestinians are looking for.",

In fact, the Arab powers at the time took advantage of the restrictions placed by Britain over Jews, making it so that they couldn’t immigrate to Eretz Israel in the years leading up to the Holocaust, by encouraging Muslims to move to the holy land (which is why the population more than doubles from 1890-1914). This proves a difficult one to balance with the arguments over Aliyah and granting Jewish-Israeli citizenship. At least half of the Palestinians of 1948 were immigrants or their descendants. \n\nMy issue on arguing about who got there first, who colonised who yada yada is that it’s absolutely pointless when you consider the immigration rates. Regardless of who has more Canaanite/Levantine DNA, both groups are largely just immigrants with no personal claim to the land beyond the agreements/consequences of war and policy granting them it. They have distinct attachments to the land and their own, valid reasons for wanting it too. \n\nThe only thing that should matter is current affairs with consideration of the current politics and recent history, given they call it home and may have done since living memory recalls. All this ‘we got there first!’ crap is juvenile. Both sides are very guilty of letting this be the Crown Jewels of their stance, causing major disagreement and bias that is essentially irrelevant. Nobody wants to answer the question of what would happen if one gets kicked out because the other ‘wins.’ And yet here we are, still arguing about who had it first, as if nothing else matters.",

It's on migration routes between Africa, Europe, Asia and the ME. It had been conquered and reconquered more times than I can count. Each causing displacement and migration. \n\nThe modern-day Palestinians are descendents of the impacts of that. I'm sure many can trace their genetics to the area for thousands of years. Some are much newer arrivals.\n\nJews mostly left at the hands of the Romans. They were at the mercy of the host countries. To some success, and major tragedy. They won the rights to govern the land by declaration of the Colonial powers. The Palestinians were dispersed as a result of an Arab war of genocidal intent. The Nakba is real. However, most usually fail to accept that the Palestinians were kept as perpetual refugees at the hands of Arabs.\n\nJordan was intended to be the Palestinian state, than then they added the WB and Gaza. It was not enough. The Arabs started a war to get the rest, and lost. Between 48 and 67, Jordan and Egypt could have made the WB &amp; Gaza Palestinian. They did not. Jordan, Syria and Jordan could have absorbed and resettled Palestinians. They did not.\n\nThey Palestinians that ended up staying have full and equal rights in Israel and arguably have the best quality of life for Arabs in MENA. The Palestinians in Lebanon and Syria have limits on where they can live, what profession they can do, etc.\n\nThere were many Palestinians made refugees during the Nakba. There were slightly more Jews made refugees from Arab and Moslims countries at the same time. Israel took them in and absorbed them.\n\nOne group was trying to make the best of things, the other was used as a weapon. You can see the unfortunate results.\n\nObviously, there is much, much more to it. But I can't write an encyclopedia on Reddit.",

By 1948, there were 1.5 million. People forget that the whole “making the desert bloom” thing is real. Palestine really was mostly desert and malaria-infested swamps until the First Aliyah (1880-1903). Those Jews drained the swamps and implemented responsible land management and once it was proven the land could be profitable, more people from the surrounding areas began moving in. Most of the “Palestinian refugees” from the war of independence were there for less time than the First Aliyah Jews were. Thats not even to mention the Old Yishuv Jews. People also forget that the total number of Arabs expelled from Israel after they lost the war is fewer than the number of Jews expelled from Arab countries after the war.",

Let's remember the last time the USA dwelled into Iran's politics they chose to believe their s... ambassador, he was so full of himself, and bought Khomeini's lies, and never apologized for betting at wrong horse, so I would say they are going to think it many times over before doing anything.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm going to be very surprised if neither the CIA nor the Mossad are already propping the people demonstrating in some capacity but openly doing anything? It goes beyond everything the USA does post W. Bush, Trump closes bases, he does not open them, and the further they are about to go are the Americas: their backyard. The USA can already manage over 60% of their oil needs, why messing with Iran when they can get that off Venezuela? Notwithstanding the fact Brazil is heading to a change later this year which would make their reserves available, I'm Argentinian so thanks to our production we can help a bit too, same goes for gas. It might have been an issue in both the 70s and 80s but the USA needn't Iran that much but would have love for a regime change. In any case as a lot of people said here already the locals need to do their bit, it's pointless otherwise.\n\nAs for Israel's, I'm going to be very surprised if this does not play exactly into their aims: Hamas is mostly beaten and they didn't make the same mistake of retreating off Gaza as they did in 2005 without proper reassurances, in any case the yellow line would end up becoming the new border with Gaza. As predicted they lost more territory yet again.  \nHezbollah is gone, Israel took more land in Syria and is propping the Druzes so they can go full independent and create a state buffer they can be friends with, Jordan isn't an issue anymore nor is Egypt (although they were of course helping the Gazan in an informal way). Getting rid of the Iranian's menace even if it means getting them off the board for the next years would be a huge coup for them.\n\nAs for the \"Pali\" cause is yet another nail in their delusional coffin.",

I can only speak with great clarity on what I want, and what people I know, who have been willing to share with me, want.\n\nIt should be obvious to anyone that what an indigent parent in Gaza burying their fifth child prioritizes will often be quite different than what an enormously wealthy Palestinian expat prioritizes or what a Christian college-aged student native to a Western country prioritizes.\n\nIt should similarly be obvious to anyone that an Israeli grandfather who lost a child to a bus bombing will have different priorities than a fourth-generation Jewish-American that has never experienced meaningful antisemitism or a Christian fundamentalist preacher who believes Jesus will only return if the Jews control the Holy Land.\n\nUltimately, however, we do have to recognize that most people who care enough about this conflict to talk about it on social media are going to be very distrustful of anything that looks one-sided in favor of \"their side.\"  The sad reality is that almost anything you can criticize from either side has a \"yes, but isn't that a reaction to...\" until we're talking about provoking incidents from thousands of years ago, because the seeds of this conflict really were planted that long ago.\n\nThe people in charge of Israel don't trust anyone but Jewish people to safeguard the long-term interests of Jewish people, not after thousands of years of antisemitism.  I believe that is a justified fear, and I can't really imagine that changing in my lifetime, because there were periods of safety for Jewish people in places for longer than one lifetime until suddenly there was existential danger.  This certainly doesn't mean that I agree with every policy decision made by Israeli leadership nor does it mean that I don't have sympathy for Palestinian suffering.  But very little of that criticism or sympathy is going to show up in a conversation with someone who doesn't acknowledge and respect that existential fear, and understand why things like a one-state solution that leads to an Islamic majority or the formation of an armed Palestinian state with leadership that has promised and continues to promise our destruction just isn't on the table.  If we're going to talk about actual peace, not just a brief respite before the next explosion, there has to have a convincing answer to the question of Jewish safety.\n\nAnd similarly, although I have less of a personal connection to the Palestinians than I do my fellow Jewish people, any real peace has to address a number of very legitimate Palestinian grievances in some meaningful way that makes them feel safe as well.  I don't expect them to \"just trust Israel\" to protect them any more than I expect Israel to \"just trust\" them.",

If you look at your post insights you can see the demographics. When I do so i see people from Israel is like below 10%. It varies by post though. \n\nIf you want to see what Israelis think there is the YouTube channel the ask project by Corey Gil Shuster.  He asks random people on the street their opinion and it’s variable. He asks both Israelis and Palestinians which may be of interest to you. \n\nPersonally though I think the opinions of both Israelis and Palestinians are pretty hardened and not really poised for any mutual understanding anytime soon. \n\nThere are of course Israelis though who don’t buy the Palestinian = Hamas language anymore after serving in IDF during the war. And there are those in Gaza living in the rubble who don’t care about the Palestinian fight anymore and just want to live normal lives. Between these two people I think there is hope for an end to hostilities. \n\nYes this sub has become entrenched in the idea of Palestinian = Hamas probably as a reaction to the overwhelming pro-Palestinian chant of genocide that pretty much all of Reddit has taken up except for a few subs like this one. It’s not really a good thing though because there is a difference between Palestinians and Hamas. It’s just that Hamas didn’t wear uniforms during the war which blurred the lines between soldier and civilian. And made IDF desensitized, put civilians at risk, and made for many harsh rules to protect IDF soldiers. \n\nYou are probably right Israel will want to win, take land if they can. It may not totally be up to Israel at this point though they are a sovereign nation, they are still pretty much the little brother to America. \n\nI feel like at this point it is an Israel or Palestine situation though—the two peoples cant live together and both want to dominate. It is not ideal but maybe it is inevitable anyway for there to be a winner and a loser.",

We'll just call them 'Outsiders' and \"Insiders'  \n  \nAnd the end goals of these two groups are very diffrent.  \n  \nThe Outsider, will say something like 'We want just one secular state where everyone can be free' That same Outsider will reply if asked, \"what sort of government would that be?\"  and it likely to say very vague or perhaps \"Well that up to the Palestinians, they will have to decide\"    \nIn other words the 'Outsider Pro Palestinian'  does not see any responsibility on what happens if the 'one state' becomes a nightmare for the 'former' Israelis. They wash their hands of the consequences, or quietly (or loudly) think that what the Zionists deserve, and they brought in on themselves.  So even if 100% of the Outsiders want a peaceful new perfected State with everyone happy and peaceful, they still bow to the 'Insiders' to decide exactly how 'peaceful' that new State will be.\n\nSo lets look at the 'Insiders', that will be the Palestinians that will actually 'take over' perhaps even run it as some class of democracy. The people who would actually 'live' and 'run' this new 'perfected' State.  Do the 'Insiders' believe in co-existence? Are there Polls that can tell us how peaceful they would be if they were in charge? We like to pretend its 'just Hamas' but Hamas is a symptom of a culture that accepts and even celebrates the current violence. Polls still show super majority of the Palestinians in both Gaza and West Bank support the actions of 'Hamas' so even if Hamas disappeared tomorrow and some new group arose to take the lead to 'run' this new imaginary One State, the fundamental beliefs in violence as the solution will not have been exercised. The new 'State' would soon become a bloody civil war that makes the last few years look peaceful. \n\nAnd the 'Outsiders' will have no influence or even interest in cooling this violence. They will probably ignore it for some other newer cause of the day. \n\n  \n(BTW I personally despise the violent Settlers in the WB and wish Israel would withdraw to the 67 lines, but just as so many Palestinian supporters excuse the violence of the Palestinian's as 'natural reaction to years of oppression'  I have seen with the fading of hope for peace, the violent Settlers are just the 'natural reaction to years of Palestinian hate' It goes both ways.)",

The suffering is real and tragic, but it's also the deliberate product of leadership that has rejected every peace offer since 1937 because maintaining the conflict serves their interests far better than actually building a state, and the international community keeps rewarding this strategy by treating Palestinians as permanent victims who bear no responsibility for their choices. You want to discuss less harm and more freedom for everyone, which sounds noble, but you can't have that conversation without acknowledging *that one side has repeatedly chosen violence* while the other has built a functioning democracy under constant threat of annihilation. \n\nThis may come shocking to you but Israel didn't get handed a state on a platter either, they *fought for* it and *built it* with whatever meagre resources they had while being blockaded and attacked by every neighbor who wanted them destroyed. The Jews who survived the Holocaust didn't start launching rockets into Germany or running around Europe killing people in the streets. they took their trauma and built a prosperous nation. So when you wonder why Israelis get defensive when you express concern for Palestinian suffering, it's because that framing ignores that Palestinians are the architects of their own future and nobody's going to give them a state when they've spent 75 years proving they'd rather destroy Israel than build alongside it.\n\nIf you actually want what's best for Palestinians, stop treating them like children who can't be held accountable and start encouraging them to look in the mirror and embrace some harsh realities, ***like the fact that their betterment isn't based on how much Israel suffers***, that their lives matter more than revenge, and that building a future together with Jews requires convincing the Israeli people they're genuine partners for peace rather than massaging the egos of religious nutjobs and anti-Western dictators who use them as pawns. You came here looking for understanding and got defensive responses because many Israelis are exhausted with people who express concern for Palestinian suffering while ignoring or dismissing the context that created it, and yeah that's tribal and defensive, but when your existence has been under threat since day one and the world constantly judges you by standards applied to no other nation, you tend to get a bit sensitive about people implying both sides are equally responsible when the evidence shows otherwise.",

Losing hope is what extremists want you to do.\n\n I generally think the unreasonableness you describe is a general feature of human discourse (and to all the pro-Israelis reading this, yes this includes the Pro-Palestine side as well). Not every movement will be made up of unreasonable people to the same extent as others, but I think every major movement has them. Ironically, pretending like one side is made up of purely reasonable people is engaging in the exact tribalistic attitude you describe.\n\nAt the same time, I think we should remember that online voices are more extremist than the real world, and try not to let it get us down too much. Both sides have a vested interest in making the other side seem more extremist than they really are\n\n&gt;What I think will happen: Israel will take Gaza, or at least a sizable portion of it, and displace Palestinians. Those in the West Bank will never have a sovereign country. They will eventually be killed or removed as well, possibly following another attack or just slowly by Israeli extremist provicateurs. Isreal will “win”, whatever that may mean. There will never be peace, because there is no reason for it.\n\nI think this is spot on.

This issue above all others will dictate the solution that we must adopt. In the absence of a negotiated agreement – and I do not believe in the realistic prospect of an agreement – we need to implement a unilateral alternative... More and more Palestinians are uninterested in a negotiated, two-state solution, because they want to change the essence of the conflict from an Algerian paradigm to a South African one. From a struggle against 'occupation,' in their parlance, to a struggle for one-man-one-vote. That is, of course, a much cleaner struggle, a much more popular struggle – and ultimately a much more powerful one. For us, it would mean the end of the Jewish state... the parameters of a unilateral solution are: **To maximize the number of Jews; to minimize the number of Palestinians**; not to withdraw to the 1967 border and not to divide Jerusalem... Twenty-three years ago, Moshe Dayan proposed unilateral autonomy. On the same wavelength, we may have to espouse unilateral separation... [it] would inevitably **preclude a dialogue with the Palestinians for at least 25 years.**\n\n(Landau, D. ‘Maximum Jews, Minimum Palestinians’: Ehud Olmert speaks out. *Haaretz.* November 13, 2003.)\n\n---\n\nDov Weissglass, **senior adviser to PM Sharon**:\n\n&gt; **The significance of the disengagement plan is the freezing of the peace process,** and when you freeze that process, you prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, and you prevent a discussion on the refugees, the borders and Jerusalem. Effectively, this whole package called the Palestinian state, with all that it entails, has been removed indefinitely from our agenda. And all this with authority and permission. All with a presidential blessing and the ratification of both houses of Congress. That is exactly what happened. You know, the term 'peace process' is a bundle of concepts and commitments. The peace process is the establishment of a Palestinian state with all the security risks that entails. **The peace process is the evacuation of settlements, it's the return of refugees,** it's the partition of Jerusalem. And all that has now been frozen... **what I effectively agreed to with the Americans was that part of the settlements would not be dealt with at all, and the rest will not be dealt with** ***until the Palestinians turn into Finns.*** That is the significance of what we did.\n\n(Shavit, A. Top PM aide: Gaza plan aims to freeze the peace process. *Haaretz*. October 6, 2004.)\n\n***\n\nSo, the purpose of the 2005 \"Disengagement\" Plan—as stated by its architects—was to prevent the coalescence of a unified movement for Palestinian statehood.",

Everyone in a position of enough leadership they'd be held accountable for bad real-world outcomes, is very comfortable smashing transnational ideological \"resistance\" movements with Israel's inexhaustible help.

This is likely from the story of Jacob, renamed Israel which means \"He who struggles with God\" for the story of him wrestling an angel or God depending on who you talk to.\n\nBut as far as how I think language could be used for this... Palestine is the whole region, Israel is part of it, West Bank and Gaza are also part of it. This just makes it easier. Israel is in Palestine, and Palestine is like saying \"Pacific Northwest\" for like Portland and Seattle etc... It's just easier this way imo since Palestine has never been a nation state.\n\nBut I find it really... interesting that the earliest mention of Palestine carries the same meaning as the word Israel.

    "body": "it's a good post because you're touching on one of the main issues. There are two narratives here. \n\nOne is the Jewish people narrative. Jews have lived in the Land of Israel and Judea for 3000+ years. Jews have a rich history, they had a nation here, Jerusalem is their capital, and Jews have fought to get their country back. And everything Jews did in pursuit to get their country back was also legitimate - they did fight for it against occupiers but they also had the international law justification. Similar to the US vs the  British and the Treaty of Paris.  Jews are a people with a religion and the religion revolves around Eretz Yisrael and therefore Zionism is inherently linked to Judaism and it is not a seperate thing. There are Jews that disagree but there were also redcoats, Uncle Toms etc in every Nation's struggle. As things evolved there is one Jewish state and 20+ Arab states and 50+ Islamic states. many of these states were created with total disregard to any actual peoples like Kurds or Berbers or Arameans or Maronites or Balouchis or Druze, and there is no justification in the world to attack and blame and scapegoat the one tiny Jewish state in the whole world.\n\nThe other narrative is the Palestinian. Here the idea is that even if Jews had a nation in the past in the meantime there were other things happening in the same area which they now prefer to call Palestine. And even these Jews were just a religion so really everything is Palestinian people even if they never called it as such. What they also want to say without saying it too loudly is that because the entire area was ruled by Islam then it became dar al-Islam and must remain under Islamic rules. Jews can live as dhinmis but never as sovereign. Jerusalem while never even a district capital, lower than Ramle, under Islamic rule, is now retroactively classified as important to Islam just like every place Islam conquered. The Temple Mount is now the the site of Muhammad's ascent to Heaven. Because they can say so.  So under this general narrative you have to ignore the fact it's part of Arab and Islam conquest but to pretend for a second that its all about an indigenous Palestinian population that has been subjugated and oppressed by the colonizing White Man which in this case is somehow actually the Jews. And just to reinforce it, the narrative is that the Jews in this case are not even Jews. They might be Khazars. Or Polish. And they were and still are illegally supported by the Empires like the British (even though history says exactly the opposite but you have to look at the big picture).  Easy to insert to this narrative also the Jewish cabals and elders of zion stuff because the theory is that Israel only exists under this narrative because of Jewish control of the media and of course the USA.\n\nThat's the two narratives and people can decide which one is more relatable according to their understandings.",

Thanks for sharing your perspective, friend.\n\nLoved that you brought up Eretz Yisrael and I really appreciated your mention of Dar al-Islam, it’s a sharp historical lens that highlights how Islamic governance traditionally entailed that non-Muslims could live in the territory but were not sovereign. It also helps explain why some historical and ideological currents among Palestinians aim to limit or disenfranchise non-Islamic subjects, in particular Jews. These two ideologies were destined to be at odds with one another. Perhaps we were doomed centuries ago.\n\nAt the same time, I think the narrative as you describe it leans a bit heavily on that religious framing. There are many Palestinians today who articulate their claims through a secular, nationalist, or human-rights frame rather than in explicitly religious or legalistic ones. And many Israelis truly do view these people as subhuman, no legal/moral arguments to be had. Reducing the Palestinian narrative mainly to Islamic supremacy risks oversimplifying the diversity of perspectives and motivations that exist.\n\nI do agree with your broader point: both sides are defending deeply structured existential narratives, not just policies or land. Recognizing the selective nature of these narratives shaped by memory, trauma, and shifting sociopolitical dynamics doesn’t delegitimize either side, but it does help explain why the conversation is so charged and resistant to simplification.",

But I think ultimately it will always go back to the core, because there are enough religious people out there. You cannot actually be a secular Muslim and we can try and reform Islam like many critics of Islam out there say so (and I get it, you could make some claims against certain orthodox Judaism as well), but it is going to fail. It will fail because it takes a small number of people to destroy it. So even if you assume it will be a small number, all it takes is a little bit of terror with devastating effects, and it will go really south. I saw that during the Oslo Accords in the 90s. The Israeli government kept claiming that it is only Hamas (and Islamic Jihad) and that these groups like Hamas are enemies of peace. But Israelis kept dying in horrible ways from suicide bombings, so the argument seemed ludicrous and many /most people in Israel could not really fathom why they were in the peace process to begin with. And unfortunately it's not a small number. I think over 90% of Palestinians believe in this Islamic dogma against Israel, and it is reinforced day after day in Mosques, whether in the Middle East or other countries.  So remember the denazzification after World War 2 in Germany. That's a really high bar to do let's say in Gaza.  And therefore this conflict will remain inherently religious.\n\nAnd good job mentioning the trauma. That is indeed a driving force to the conflict where many people, in my opinion, simply ignore the deep decades long trauma for Israeli people (irrespective of Holocaust etc. just in Israel/Palestine itself.)",

Israel is the more indigenous true name but it doesn't mean Palestine has to be an antagonistic name to Jews, you're right. It's insulting in some ways (which is why, wisely, EY short for Eretz Yisrael, was added to the official name of the British Mandate) but it is also a modern English name. It is only after the PLO founded in 1964 that they started this so called Palestinian conflict and Free Palestine etc. Palestine was constantly refered by people as land of the Jews before 1948 and UN planned to have a Jewish state and an Arab state IN PALESTINE. And that was perfectly fine before definitions got confused. Each country would have been welcome to choose their name.

That’s because *support [somebody]* has two meanings, which *can* overlap, but can also completely contradict each other. “Support” can mean subjective support from the recipient’s perspective: praise, validation, platforming, and no-strings donations of exactly what they ask for. But “support” can also mean *objective* support, by giving the recipient not what they seek or say they seek, but what they *clearly and logically would benefit from*, whether they asked for it, or will appreciate it, or not.\n\nNote that the most common and low-effort type of support known as “raising awareness” can fall into either category.\n\nIn medicine, a patient’s chief complaint (the reason they say they’re here) is always written verbatim in the visit note. That’s because whether or not it’s true at face value, the words the patient chose are nevertheless a valuable clue as to how this patient thinks and communicates, how he conceptualizes the problem, and what the problem, and his hoped-for way of treating it, means to him.",

Give them a reason to care about what happens to you, and find yourself a reason to care about what happens to them! If you just look for it you will find someone just like you but on the other side who deserves that kindness and who thinks you deserve it too. I promise.\n\n\nLet go of all the hatred and pain. It's harming you and it's harming your neighbors. Hatred and pain have never brought anything good to anyone ever. It's a sickness, it's not a solution.\n\n\nSet a good example for others to follow! Show people how to forgive and how to build trust, compassion and mutual respect! Don't wait around for your political leaders on either side to do that because they won't until you show them with your actions that it is the right thing to do, and also that it is politically feasible, that it's not a death sentence for either party and that the true will of the people is peace, friendship and mutual dignity. \n\n\nFind common ground, find something to joke about with your would-be enemy and laugh together. \nShare food. Meet each other's grandparents, the grandparents who are tough as nails who survived so much. On both sides. They are not enemies, they have so much in common with each other and they deserve a chance to see you thrive together like good neighbors. The kind of neighbors who check on you when you're sick and drive you to the hospital if you're not doing good and bring you food when you're grieving.\n\n\nDemand peace.\nDemand forgiveness.\nDemand that all the old grievances be left behind in the past and forgotten.\nDemand mutual recognition and respect.\nDemand mutual coordination and security for partnerships, both public and private sector.\nDemand cooperation and direct regular personal meetings and phonecalls between leaders and representatives from both sides in good faith and goodwill.\n\n\nIf you can do that, this problem will solve itself and the world will be a better place.",

From the Umayyads to the Abbasids, to maybe even the Ottoman empire, after Islamic colonialism and the Early Muslim Conquests initiated by Muhammad, one religious group ruled. Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians (to some extent) on the other hand, were grouped under \"dhimmi status\"; second class citizens who had to pay the Jizya tax. Treated like an afterthought while the Muslims got all the history written about.\n\nA clear representation of Muslim superiority began to be challenged after significant Ottoman losses (for example, in Vienna) and the end of the Golden Age of Islam. Now, the Ottoman empire was being outcompeted by their European, majority Christian neighbors and regarded as the \"sick man of Europe\". But at the very least, Muslim peoples still ruled over the Middle East, the status quo stayed.\n\nWW1 shattered this reality, now these lands were occupied by European colonialists, complete foreigners with silly accents and sh#tty food /s. Now, a struggle for independence ensured, led through the plentiful Arab revolts in the Middle East.\n\nEventually, European powers got tired of holding on to the land, and in 1947 the UN decided to divide the land known as \"Palestine\" between Arabs and Jews. Completely unacceptable. For centuries, Muslims ruled over it, this was a perceived sign of weakness among the people; that a minority group they once dominated over was seemingly one upping them. The newly established Arab countries attacked the newly born Israel shortly after, only to lose. Hundreds of thousands were displaced.\n\nThis is the problem in my opinion, I bet they are often thought about the Islamic Golden Age and the Conquests, viewing it as a source of pride, a source of superiority, which is challenged in modern times now that a Jewish state was created after losing a humiliating war. This is the reason why so many cannot grasp that Jews are indigenous. A good chunk do hold such view.",

    "body": "I think your comments conflate a lot of things and state inaccuracies. Sorry if this reads as combative. Not my intent. I'll address just one point which you devoted most time to: peoplehood and nationhood.\n\nThe very notion of a nation state appeared in the 18th and 19th centuries when nation states were forming everywhere. Pan Arab nationalism picked up as the Ottomans were collapsing. Finally with the partitioning of Syria, Jordan and Palestine by the British and French (Sykes Picot agreement, San Romeo), and Zionism becoming increasingly prominent, the nationalist movement picked up on earnest. None of this was \"invented\" by the Soviets. What the Bolsheviks did was leak the agreement, causing much dismay amongst the Arabs due to earlier promises by the British.\n\nIn the same way, there was no such thing as a Jewish nation. There was a concept of the Jewish people, absolutely. Jews in Europe in fact wanted to emphasize assimilation and not confuse peoplehood with statehood for fear of accusations of disloyalty. Sadly this is what happened in Europe (Dreyfus affair for e.g). This antisemitism caused the Nationalism movements to pick up, including Zionism, Jewish Territorialism etc.\n\nSo, no, neither Zionists nor Palestinians are ancient nations. And yes, Jews are an ancient people. And yes, Palestinians have lived in Palestine for millennia. They had an evolving culture based on whichever empire was ruling them and started developing a national identity by the end of the 19th century. In any case, they did not deserve to be ethnically cleansed for nation building.",

I'm arguing that Zionism and Palestinian nationalism were spurred by the events of the 18-19th centuries, which is typically considered the age of natiom states. It was a new call for nationhood, not a continuity of an ancient polity.\n\nThere is only a shallow parallel with Canadian First nations. They continue to live in the nation state that disenfranchised them. The Rashiduns, Umayyads, Abbassids, Mamluks, Crusaders, Ottomans and later the British were not the inheritors of Romans. So any attempt to make a nation in Palestine would necessarily be a new conflict.\n\nThe Zionist Movement sought to displace native Palestinians from their native homeland by coercion if necessary, which ultimately resulted in violence. This possibility was already part of the Zionist Congresses starting in 1897. There is no question that Arabs - outside Palestine and inside - also perpetrated violence. But I will argue that that violence, whether or not justified, did not happen in a vacuum, but on the threat of Palestinians loosing their homes and asirations of nationhood. (Falastin, Al-Karmil were popular anti-Zionist papers started by Palestinian Christians in 1910s and will give you a good idea of the discourse).",

I first noticed this among Japanese, but have since seen it in observantly Orthodox Jews and frankly most Arabs I’ve encountered: far less openness to, and expectation of, forming new close human relationships in adulthood, compared to mainstream American society. Instead, adulthood is more for cultivating and maintaining the close relationships I have already made, with the handful of people fate threw me together with as a child.\n\nAs a Westerner born-and-raised, I don’t relate. But I sure can see this logically: if I had to get along with the same cohort of people, whom I never chose and cannot disrespect (never mind alienate!), I sure would “go along to get along” with everything *my people* thought and believed and taught me.

The fact that they don't take this simple step before spreading false information about the Hebrew language means that they probably don't care what is true. When you take on a conspiracy theory like that, you aren't simply something who didn't hear the truth.

The deeper into and more committed to their echo chamber a person is, the less likely they are to tolerate more than the most transactional of interactions with people whose own reality tunnels are incompatible with theirs. And negation of Team Israel’s preferred narrative, and opposition to Team Israel’s collective goal, are rather central to Team Palestine’s preferred narrative / reality tunnel / basic worldview.\n\nThink of it this way. Both ethnic groups, both of which were founded in the Levant and descend from its aboriginal inhabitants, are working with *many of* the same set of historical data points. But they play connect-the-dots with them very differently. The two tribes draw the lines of causal connection between these historico-folkloric landmarks in time without any collaboration with, and limited reference to, each other’s efforts. And when taking into consideration the data points the two groups *don’t* share in common, it’s no wonder they end up seeing, and drawing, two completely different pictures with the points in front of them.\n\nI’ll not speak for anyone else. In my judgement, after lengthy consideration, Team Israel makes a much stronger case for the connect-the-dots picture they drew corresponding to the objective reality that none of us are privy to.\n\nBut Team Palestine is committed. They’re *all in*, and have been agged on to be all-in by some powerful moneyed interests for generations now.To give up his preferred narrative / reality tunnel would be a very ungrounding and socially alienating experience for most members of Team Palestine. So they do they only thing they can do: assume the Israeli preferred narrative is build entirely on lies, misinformation, wishful thinking, and justification of what has no justification. And they double down. Because true or not, the Israeli side of the story utterly unacceptable, corrosive of all they live and breathe for, and a disgrace to the loved ones’ lives lost and great sacrifices already made.",

At the beginning of Zionism c.1900, notables like Yousef al-Khalidi said “Who can deny the rights of Jews to Palestine? … historically, it is indeed your country! … But … let Palestine alone … there are places yet uninhabited where millions of unfortunate Israelites could be settled …”  ￼\n\nIn 1930 the Muslim Waqf which maintains the holy sites published a tourist guide to the Al Aqsa Temple Mount which matter of factly stated it was built over the ruins of the Jewish Second Temple and the Western Wall aka al-Buraq was a Temple retaining wall (though they of course did not say that qualified that as a current Jewish holy or prayer site and there were frequent clashes about prayers at the Wall at the time).\n\nNow the official line is that the Jews were *never there* and the Israel Antiquities Authority archaeology projects which they’ve always opposed are either:\n\n(1) a nefarious plot to physically undermine or blow up the Al Aqsa and Temple Mount, an obsessive delusion going back to the first British and French archaeologists c. 1870 who were admittedly in those days often borderline tomb robbers and too liberal with TNT,\n\n—OR—\n\n(2) A deception of the Jews to plant fake artifacts to gin up their phony claims about ever existing in Jerusalem.\n\nArchaeology was and is one of the main points of friction in Jerusalem.  Significantly and surprisingly, some of the biggest archeological finds ever in Jerusalem, indeed in the world today, are ongoing in the Silwan neighborhood near City of David [as described in a 2022 article by Andrew Lawler in Archaeology Magazine](https://files.constantcontact.com/e43a44f1401/a696699e-da2b-44bd-8056-f6f8010215c0.pdf).\n\nI spent a week in 2024 as a volunteer laborer at the IAA Givati Dig and was shown around some of the other newer areas being excavated like the ancient pilgrimage road up the mountain to the Temple from Herod’s time buried under 65 feet of fill recently opened to the public since I was there and the huge mikvah at the foot of the road.  It’s absolutely mind blowing to me that all of this stuff from 800BCE can be pulled from the earth to begin with and that some of the greatest finds are happening right now in 2026 as we speak.

Just because someone in England or France says \"Allahu Akbar\" or \"Inshallah\", doesn't make it part of common English or French. It's still Arabic.\n\nThere is actually surprisingly little influence of Arabic on modern Hebrew than one could expect under the circumstances.\n\nAs to similarity, as it is the case for all related languages, it depends on circumstances. There are occasions when one could be genuinely surprised by how similar some sentences may sound. They are however not anywhere close to being mutually intelligible. Very broadly speaking, when language splits into two dialects, they remain mutually intelligible for about 1,000 years of separate development; there are 4k-5k years separating Hebrew and Arabic; that's a lot.\n\nIn theory, someone intelligent, very proficient in Hebrew (including rarely used and archaic roots), and knowing 100-200 common Arabic words and basic grammar, given enough time, with considerable difficulty, but may be able to understand the broad meaning of written Arabic text (and probably vice versa). \n\nSo two languages are related, far beyond being mutually intelligible, with a number of loan words in Hebrew which came from Arabic. \"Extremely similar\" is probably is exaggeration.",

It just talks about it as a political anti-Zionist identity claimed by Arabs who happen to live in the physical area of the historic Ottoman vilayet of Palestine. (and spends a lot of time talking about elite qur'anic scholarship in Jerusalem for some reason, which really seems more like an argument for a lack of a separate identity than in favor of one). \n\nHis only real disagreement with my post above is that he declares the identity as starting earlier (ie to the first Aliyah). I wouldn't necessarily even argue this, it's more a matter of terminology: there was obviously Arab violence toward Jews from the start, it's just that their nationalism transitioned from being more Pan-Arabic to being about a specific 'Palestinian' nation in the 60s.\n\nBut it's still purely political.",

Massive, sweeping changes that modern Hebrew speakers struggle to even comprehend without good education.\n\nModern Hebrew has past tense, present tense, future tense as conjugations. Ancient Hebrew didn't even have temporal tenses, and the conjugations that are used today existed but meant entirely different things. The modern present tense form of a verb corresponds to the participle form in Hebrew. So \"Walk\" as a verb in modern Hebrew would mean \"walker\" in old Hebrew. Also verbs were conjugated not just by who did them but also whom they affected. So a verb in ancient Hebrew is, long story short, only comprehensible as a root to someone who only knows modern Hebrew. You would not know the difference between \"Knowledge,\" \"He knew it,\" \"They will know,\" \"knower,\" \"Unknown...\" You would just be able to identify the basic root and maybe a few bits of the information around it. So if a modern Hebrew speaker without good education reads ancient Hebrew, it's a sort of soup of mostly familiar words from which they can extract basic meaning but can't really understand what the relationships are between the things. And while basic narrative texts would be understandable, the laws and the poems of ancient Hebrew are basically mumbo-jumbo if you aren't a serious scholar.\n\nHowever, this assumes a modern Hebrew speaker with no knowledge of ancient Hebrew. This basically doesn't exist.\n\nModern Hebrew speakers tend to be quite well educated, and if they aren't it's because they're super religious. So they will have had a lot of exposure to ancient Hebrew and end up getting used to it. All the important parts have been repeated so many times that you probably know them basically anyway.\n\nBut saying it's \"basically the same with minor changes\" is wild.",

There is some shared cultural ancestry for Eastern Slavic peoples that goes back to the Kievan Rus, but that was a state centered in Kiev, so if you are going to use that as an argument, you could as easily claim Russia should be a part of Ukraine. \n\nIn any case, after the Mongol conquest of Ruthenia, and then then decline of the Mongol empire (and the Golden Horde), present day Ukraine came mostly under control of first the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and then the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth from the mid 14th to mid 18th centuries. It was during this period that distinct Ruthenian and then Ukrainian languages developed from the Old East Slavic language.  While the Russian empire did gain control of Kiev and some areas East of the Dneiper River in the mid 17th century, most of present day Ukraine wasn't conquered by the Russian Empire until the reign of Catherine the Great in the late 18th century.\n\nThen, after Ukrainians fought for and gained independence in 1917, the Ukrainian People's Republic eventually became the Ukrainian SSR, which became one of the founding member states of the UN in 1945. This is similar to Belarus. Even as part of the USSR, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova were all distinct SSRs. Would you say that these were all part of Russia?",

Many of the Native American nations moved around lots not so long before the actual creation of America. Maoris are considered indigenous in New Zealand. Have a [look at the arrival times for their people on a map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_people#/media/File:First_human_migration_to_New_Zealand.svg) and you will see its even 14th century. What's important is that, when the world became all connected, from the 17th to 20th Century, New Zealand, and nowhere else was the origin and center of Maori culture.\n\nHowever, Arab / Muslim culture can never be indigenous in Palestine for different reasons. Arab culture in Palestine maintains it's active links with the original locations of Arab culture centered around Mecca (and also other locations such as Medina - like Jewish culture, because Arab culture is intertwined with Islam it's a complex discussion and you might also take it back to all of the nomadic Arab tribes beforehand). Although the original conquest of Palestine was in the 7th century there were ongoing conquests - importantly for this, the Mamelukes returned Arab culture to the area in the 12th century and the Ottomans in the 16th renewed the Muslim nature of the culture. \n\nMost importantly Palestinian Arabs do not recognize any indigenous Canaanite religions. Some Palestinians have a proportion Canaanite genetics, often from conquered Jews who were forcibly converted and enslaved or just simply joined into Arab culture, abandoning their indigenous culture. Palestinians generally however do not maintain any Canaanite culture and they do not maintain links with that history. \n\nWhat's key in the end is that, whilst Judaism and Jewishness are parts of Canaanite originated culture, native to the area of Judea, Arabism is an import that came together with conquest and inherently not indigenous to the area. \n\nThe real question, though, is what does it matter. What difference if someone arrived in the 16th century or the 19th? For culture it's that Judaism is a representation of a historical culture which has a unique origin in the region. Declaring indignity is meant as an important part of ensuring that historical knowledge and understanding is maintained. However, for two people born in a place, to legal residents of that place, whether of indigenous or colonial cultures they both should be allowed to stay in the place of their birth.",

In other words, it was the willingness of the Palestinians to bet the farm on violent conflict as a way to push the Jews out that resulted in their permanent exile. The Israelis don't want those people inside Israel. They don't want them as neighbors, especially since they've continued on with violent action. Those Arabs who remained right where they were were allowed to stay and, today, are citizens of the state of Israel.

The civil war of 1947, and the Arab invasion of 1948, were intended to push the Jews out. The Arabs were tired of all these Jews showing up in Palestine, buying land, and making themselves a pain in the ass by dominating industry, developing land, and basically creating prosperity and pushing for their own country. \n\nI can understand why the Arabs were somewhat annoyed, as it completely disrupted their traditional way a life. But that's no excuse to start a violent terror campaign and an open conflict targeting men, women and children. They bet the farm that violence would succeed. It didn't succeed. The Jews won and the Palestinians and the Arab nations supporting them lost. It's kind of understandable that, after the war, the Israelis wouldn't want the Palestinians back. They didn't trust them. They didn't want them as friends, as colleagues, or as neighbors. I get that completely. Why would you invite a group of people to return who'd just tried to get rid of you?\n\nThe Coles Notes version of what I'm saying is this: if the Arabs hadn't turned to violence, they'd probably be living inside Israel to this day.

    "body": "You make a fair point that human history is full of migration but claiming the word \"Indigenous\" has no valid meaning is historically and legally incorrect. In international law and sociology, being Indigenous isn't just about who biologically stepped on a piece of land first. It is defined by the relationship between a people and a dominant power. It specifically refers to communities that existed before colonial invasion or conquest and who maintain distinct cultural and political systems separate from the dominant society.\n\nYour argument about everyone being from Africa relies on a logical fallacy. While the human species biologically originated in Africa, \"Indigeneity\" refers to where a specific culture and people group emerged. Afrikaners arrived with an established Dutch culture and imposed it; they did not develop as a distinct people group from the land in the same way the Khoisan did. That is the key difference.\n\nRegarding the English or Finns, they generally aren't part of the \"Indigenous\" conversation because they hold the power in their own lands. The term is most useful when describing marginalised groups fighting to preserve their pre-colonial identity. So, while you are right that ancient history shouldn't necessarily grant modern real estate rights, the term itself describes a very real political status that protects groups from being wiped out by colonisation.",

That context matters.\n\nA useful analogy is this:\nIf a family buys land, builds a home, raises generations there, buries their dead there, and organizes their lives around that land... centuries later an armed outsider arrives, redraws the property lines, declares legal ownership, and enforces it with violence.

    "body": "i don't really like the word \"indigenous\", especially in the context of the middle east, where borders have shifted repeatedly and dramatically over thousands of years. the region has seen many populations arrive, settle, mix, and leave, which gradually reshaped genetics, cultures, and languages. some languages went extinct, others were revived after centuries of disuse, some languages remained but are only spoken by a handful of people. even the concept of \"indigenous\" itself is not fixed. it is a *working definition* developed by the UN. the definition is usually selectively applied by people to support a particular political narrative.\n\n1. some people define indigeneity primarily by genetics. a higher percentage of DNA tied to a particular land. under this definition of indigeneity, technically samaritans and palestinian christians would be the most indigeneous, since they are among the least genetically mixed groups in the region and show the strongest continuity with bronze age canaanite populations. more so than most jewish or levantine muslim populations.\n2. others argue that DNA is less important than language and cultural continuity. from that perspective, israeli jews are considered the most indigeneous, because they speak modern hebrew, which is mostly a canaanite language. hebrew speakers can often understand other canaanite languages more easily than most arabic speakers.\n\nyet both of these definitions have flaws. for example, egyptian copts primarily speak arabic today, and most cannot hold a fluent convo in coptic. however, egyptian copts are basically walking ancient egyptians genetically and historically who adopted christianity and then arabic.\n\nsimilarly israeli jews are diverse. there are ashkenazi jews, ethiopian jews, yemenite jews, and other jewish gorups that have varying degrees of non-levantine genetic mixture. they have genetic ties to the land, but those genetic ties are not as strong as samaritans and palestinian christians. at the same time, israeli jews revived hebrew language that predates the widespread rise of arabic into the region.\n\nso given this i think its better to simply say \"jews and palestinians have a connection to the land\". and then whatever comes after this is just political narratives not facts.\n\nedit: 3. and then there's the argument that indigeneity is defined primarily by having been colonized (which is basically the UN working definition).",

In the Americas, in contrast to the Levant, the Native American \"First Peoples,\" indigenous to that part of the world, only arrived there 20 or 30k years ago and created civilizations that had no contact with the rest of the world until the late 15th and early 16th centuries.\n\nHominids have been living in the Levant, however, for well over a million years, long before the existence of Homo sapiens, the modern human species. All humans who left Africa, including the Native Americans' ancestors, passed through the Levant to populate the rest of the world.\n\nThe indigeneity argument, although significant when discussing Spanish, Portuguese, French, and English colonialism in the Americas, is meaningless in the Levant and part of a concerted campaign that Adam Louis-Klein, in particular, has discussed in detail. His recent essay on Substack is really brief and concludes with this paragraph:\n\n\"...Western antizionism is far more inward-looking, guilt-ridden, and self-critical in form. Here, Jews are not only treated as external enemies but as reflections of the Western self. Israel becomes the screen onto which the West projects its historical sins—colonialism, racism, genocide—transforming Jewish survival and return into a symbol of Western failure. In this mode, Israel comes to represent the foundations of Western civilization itself, and Jews are condemned not necessarily for being Other, but for appearing as a distorted image of the West’s own crimes.\"\n\n\"Guilt ridden antizionism\" from\n***Soviet Antizionism, Western Antizionism by Adam Louis-Klein on Substack***\n\nhttps://open.substack.com/pub/conformal/p/soviet-antizionism-western-antizionism?r=7pici&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;shareImageVariant=overlay",

To me, it is defined more as the relationship between one group of people and another more dominant group within society. There is more to it than this, but this is how I view it. The UN has a webpage that is more specific. But this is how I generally think of it.\n\nYou may be surprised to know that there are groups who are considered indigenous who either did not come to the land first, or we are not sure if they did. The Sami are an example of this. Ultimately, we care about the indigenous label because of the implantation of their place in broader society. Though indigenous is still a label.

And I can get why their inhabitans have zero interest in becoming Argentinians since we aren't the posters of a sane nation either.\n\nBy the end it makes little sense if the Arabs at some point conquered it, they not only got Jordan, its biggest chunk for the mandate but, on top of it, they lost war after war, in any other conflict they might have been absorbed already and the rest kicked out without anyone being any wiser. But no, we keep forcing the status quo to remain and more wars will happen, the right to be there does not mean anything after you lost that many times in a row.\n\nThey had the chance, a real one, of state-building after 2005 and they squandered it, I doubt that will repeat themselves and they are the only ones to blame for that.",

I understand where that fear comes from. Many Palestinians reject the legitimacy of an Israeli state and call for its downfall or destruction. That makes people feel like Palestinians, if free, would pose an existential threat to Israeli Jews and essentially wipe them out. I get that fear. Especially after the Hamas massacres on October 7th and the rhetoric that they would do it again if they had the chance, as well as the imagery of Palestinians and those who stand in solidarity with them celebrating the atrocities as a victory against Israel. As well as the waves of terrorist attacks targeting Israeli civilians, escalating around moments like the second Intifada which are often framed by supporters of Palestine as important moments in the struggle for Palestinian freedom. I understand that fear.\n\nThat said, if you saw the way Palestinians were subjugated, the lines of elderly queueing for an hour or more at the Qalandiya checkpoint with metal turnstiles suddenly slamming shut in their face as they hurry on their commute into occupied East Jerusalem and to their ultimate destination to work in Israel, the ever-receding boundaries of villages as settlements and \"firing zones\" go up in the South Hebron Hills and elsewhere and are accompanied by a military presence, the arrest of young people including children, students, and activists accused of incitement or assaulting soldiers (occupying forces), the demolition of family homes due to the crimes of one family member, the loss of a never-ending tally of innocents as casualties in weekly Israeli military raids targeting militant groups (which use terror against civilians) in major cities with perceived impunity, the inability to enter or leave parts of the country due to the maze of settlements and the Israeli military police even to enter neighboring Jordan from the West Bank... if you saw the majority of Gazan homes destroyed and the majority of the West Bank swallowed by settlements, you would understand why to many Palestinians, the state of Israel is inseparable from the settlers at their doorstep, it's embodied by the soldiers in their cities, it's an endorsement of their displacement and dispossession. To you, Israel may be much more than that and much of that is an act of self-defense or the actions of the fringe of Israeli society. It's a safehaven for Jews persecuted around the world, a pocket of democracy, etc. But to Palestinians, it's the greatest thing standing between them and freedom.",

You've encouraged me to do some research on the following so I can have a more informed opinion on a) the history of negotiations between the leadership of the two nations and b) the shift in Palestinian and Israeli public opinion over time. In the meantime, can you point to examples of offers made to the Palestinians that you view as both morally acceptable and provide a clear pathway to Palestinian sovereignty within internationally recognized borders? I'm admittedly not familiar enough with the negotiations to point to one quite yet. Starting with the 1947 UN partition plan, which offered Palestinians a state on 44.5 percent of the land where they constituted 66 percent of the population following decades of mass Jewish migration under British rule, I can understand why Palestinians rejected the offer. They had been denied self-determination by the British following WWI, who instead executed a policy of population transfer resulting in demographic upheaval against the will of the locals, all with the stated goal of establishing a settler colony, followed by a Jewish state on a land where––at the time of the Balfour delcaration which committed Britain to establishing a Jewish state––Jews made up a population of 60,000, less than 10 percent of the population. The Palestinian demand for self-determination in the land which they made up an overwhelming majority if not for settlement under colonial rule does not strike me as maximalist and their reaction to the imposition of this policy with violence during the 1936-1939 Arab revolt or in 1947 does not seem morally wrong––even if they lacked the military power to achieve their aims. \n\nFeel free to point me to resources that challenge the underlying moral framework I'm using to understand the issue––that is, settler colonialism and population change at the expense of a subjugated population, culminating in a partition which denied them self-determination in the majority of their homeland. I acknowledge the Palestinian portion of the land was more fertile.\n\nI don't disagree with the notion that Palestinians have made repeated strategic failures in the face of an opponent which often wielded superior military force and eventually greater international support. There are concessions which would have served their long-term interest in survival. But can you point to specific examples of where mainstream Palestinian demands were maximalist?",

That doesn't mean they would have been morally justified in denying blacks self-determination and equal rights. Legitimate fear is not a carte blanche to deny others their rights.

For many people it also includes the Right of Return for Palestinian refugees who were displaced in 1948 and 1967. At its core, the idea is that Palestinians should have the same right to self determination and the same basic human rights that Israelis currently have.\n\nIn response to your points about social justice, a counter argument is that extremism often grows in situations of hopelessness, violence, and long term occupation. Iit is very hard to build a progressive society or properly protect vulnerable communities when people are mainly worried about survival under military control. While you noted that Israel does not have an official state religion, critics often point out that the “Nation State Law” clearly defines Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people, which in practice creates different levels of citizenship and pushes non-Jewish citizens to the margins.\n\nWhen it comes to ideas about the future, the most hopeful vision, outside of a two state solution, is one shared, secular, democratic state. In this model, everyone living between the river and the sea, no matter their religion or ethnic background, would have equal voting rights and the same legal protections. This could reduce the demographic fears you mentioned and shift the focus toward equal rights for all.

Nation State Law 2018 only pertains to Jews and mentions Arabic in literally some parts of the law so unless you're comparing Jews to Arabic there is no comparison grounds and if you're comparing Hebrew to Arabic then languages don't have inequalities. So no, there is no inequality present in that law. \n\nSecond one is also incorrect as well because the self-determination rights while having been extended to Jews is because they are indigenous to Israel and as such this caters to and is primarily centered around the indigenous rights of Jewish people. It literally says nothing about non-Jewish citizens so your thing doesn't even exist in the law. Not to mention, self-determination rights centered around indigenity for one group doesn't impact national rights of other groups at all. Australia has Australian nationals and yet they also have [Native Title Act 1993 (clth)](https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdb/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/) (**the best analog and contextual comparison of Nation State Law 2018 (Israel)**,) which confers self determination rights and recognizes the indigenity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people or ATSI Australians so Australians still have Australia as their national home but it is only ATSI Australians that have self determination per indigenous rights. \n\nIncorrect again on the 3rd one, it doesn't mention a disadvantage for other groups it only promotes Jewish settlement so the disadvantage doesn't actually exist in the law. \n\nJust flat out wrong again on this one, by saying special status is lower you are  assuming a difference between special and official when there is nothing in the law indicating that in fact section 4c specifically says *\"Nothing in this article shall compromise the status given to the Arabic language in practice, before this basic-law came into force.\"*, nothing shall compromise is the exact opposite of lower, lower means compromising the status so no there is no lowering of the language. 2nd part of this one is also incorrect, *\"Hebrew is the language of the state\"* is what they say, they never use the word only so Hebrew is in fact not the only language of the state. There is literally no only there. \n\nThe only things you manage to be correct about here is that they don't remove basic civil rights like voting and that the state belongs to one group but the rest of it literally has no basis in the law itself.",

    "body": "The key tool Israel uses to implement the principle of Jewish supremacy is engineering space geographically, demographically and politically. Jews go about their lives in a single, contiguous space where they enjoy full rights and self-determination. In contrast, Palestinians live in a space that is fragmented into several units, each with a different set of rights – given or denied by Israel, but always inferior to the rights accorded to Jews.\n\nThe Israeli regime pursues this organizing principle in four major areas:\n\nLand – Israel works to Judaize the entire area, treating land as a resource chiefly meant to benefit the Jewish population. Since 1948, Israel has taken over 90% of the land within the Green Line and built hundreds of communities for the Jewish population. Since 1967, Israel has also enacted this policy in the West Bank, building more than 280 settlements for some 600,000 Jewish Israeli citizens. Israel has not built a single community for the Palestinian population in the entire area stretching from the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River (with the exception of several communities built to concentrate the Bedouin population after dispossessing them of most of their property rights).\n \nCitizenship – Jews living anywhere in the world, their children and grandchildren – and their spouses – are entitled to Israeli citizenship. In contrast, Palestinians cannot immigrate to Israeli-controlled areas, even if they, their parents or their grandparents were born and lived there. Israel makes it difficult for Palestinians who live in one of the units it controls to obtain status in another, and has enacted legislation that prohibits granting Palestinians who marry Israelis status within the Green Line.\n \nFreedom of movement – Israeli citizens enjoy freedom of movement in the entire area controlled by Israel (with the exception of the Gaza Strip) and may enter and leave the country freely. Palestinian subjects, on the other hand, require a special Israeli-issued permit to travel between the units (and sometimes inside them), and exit abroad also requires Israeli approval.\n \nPolitical participation – Palestinian citizens of Israel may vote and run for office, but leading politicians consistently undermine the legitimacy of Palestinian political representatives. The roughly five million Palestinians who live in the Occupied Territories, including East Jerusalem, cannot participate in the political system that governs their lives and determines their future. They are denied other political rights as well, including freedom of speech and association.\n\nSOURCE: https://www.btselem.org/apartheid",

The idea that the antichrist is primarily openly anti-Christian and overtly violent is a popular culture caricature, not what the texts actually emphasize. In the New Testament, especially the Johannine letters, and Revelation, the defining feature is deception; appearing righteous, sounding moral, and leading people astray while claiming legitimacy. The “lamb-like” appearance paired with a “dragon’s voice” is the opposite of open villainy.\nMore importantly, the leap from a state level symbolic critique to “Jews now have to prove they aren’t the antichrist” is either careless or deliberately misleading. The post explicitly distinguishes between a state apparatus and Jewish people or Judaism. Collapsing those categories is not exposing antisemitism; it’s committing the very conflation the post goes out of its way to reject.\n\nLabeling any critique of a state’s behavior as “classical antisemitism” doesn’t refute the argument; it functions as a rhetorical shield. Ironically, that move mirrors the exact dynamic being analyzed, reframing criticism as heresy so the substance never has to be addressed.

It’s defined by contradiction, claiming moral righteousness while acting in direct opposition to the values it invokes (justice, mercy, restraint, and protection of the innocent), while demanding loyalty and suppressing dissent. \n\nSorry what.  The [Christian] bible directly uses the term four places:\n\n1. 1 John 2:22 -- Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the **antichrist**—denying the Father and the Son. [defines earlier use in 1Jn2:18]. \n\n2. 1 John 4:8 -- but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the **antichrist**, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.\n\n2. 2 John 1:7 -- I say this because many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the **antichrist**.\n\nBut generally in modern theology it gets tied to other prophecies of the end of the world the false prophet a king: *“And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. And it had two horns like a lamb, but spoke like a dragon. And _it executes all the authority of the first beast before it. And it causes that the earth and those dwelling in it should worship the first beast, of which was healed its deadly wound. And it does great signs, that it even causes fire to come down out of the heaven onto the earth before men. And it deceives those dwelling on the earth, because of the signs which were given to it to do before the beast* (Rev 13:11-14). \n\nThere is no hint of relativism or non-hypocrisy as the defining characteristic.  \n\n&gt; , the modern Israeli state increasingly operates as a system that places itself above accountability.\n\nFWIW this is also false.  Israel wants to be held accountable under the same rules as other states are.  The problem Israel has had it is that at least rhetorically it gets treated extremely unfairly.  https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/s658yw/yes_the_un_does_discriminate_and_incite_against/",

States are collections of individuals operating inside incentives, hierarchies, and ideologies. When scripture talks about “any person” or the “spirit of the antichrist” already at work, it’s explicitly acknowledging that individuals can embody and transmit that spirit through institutions, not just as lone villains. A system doesn’t deny truth by itself, people do, repeatedly, in coordinated ways, until that denial becomes policy.\n\nFurthermore, you’re responding to an argument I didn’t make. I wasn’t claiming Israel is a literal end times individual who verbally denies Christ, so listing prooftexts about doctrinal denial doesn’t actually engage what I wrote. I was explicit that this is a symbolic and systemic use of the antichrist / false prophet framework, which is neither novel nor fringe in Christian or political theology.\n\nIronically, the verses you cite, especially 1 John 4:3—undercut your own point by introducing the “spirit of the antichrist” as something already active in the world. That language is about patterns and forces, not just a single person. Revelation’s false prophet functions the same way: legitimizing power, enforcing loyalty, suppressing dissent, and sanctifying authority. Those are institutional roles.\n\nThat’s the lens being applied here. The argument stands on observable behavior, moral absolutism, exemption from law, reframing criticism as hostility, and demanding loyalty over accountability. If your objection depends on collapsing “antichrist” into a narrow, literal checklist while ignoring how the concept actually functions, then you’re not refuting the argument, you’re avoiding it.",

Christian nationalism clearly influences U.S. foreign policy in practice, regardless of whether it’s formally codified as a state religion.\n\nThe same applies to Israel. Whether or not it declares an official religion is beside the point. States don’t need formal theocracy to sacralize themselves. When identity, historical trauma, and moral exceptionalism are embedded into law, policy, and justification for force, religion is already operating as political insulation. That’s what’s being analyzed here; how authority shields itself from accountability, not whether a legal definition checks a particular box.\n\nAs for redirecting this argument toward Islamic theocracies... that critique already exists, widely and without controversy. Applying the same analytical framework here isn’t inconsistency, it’s intellectual honesty. Pointing to other examples doesn’t invalidate this one; it confirms that the lens is being applied evenly.

I would say even a holocaust of 20 million African people who had done nothing to the Islamic empires yet were killed in cold blood...\n\nI don't feel all Palestinians are terrorists but obviously some are. \n\nJews were oppressed and horrifically mistreated for countless centuries by the Palestinians and other Arabs and Turks.... One example of this is the pogroms of 1834 and 1838 in what is now Israel. Honestly if Jews were not such humanitarians they would probably have done what we as Africans did in Zanzibar... Where in an act of \"intifada\" we killed thousands of Arab Muslims if not tens of thousands and forcibly expelled the Arab population from our country of Zanzibar.\n\nI disagree with ALL forms of \"intifada\" which is mass murder of innocent people.

This claim is not catered for a Jewish state; I oppose any state that aims for its entire population to be that of a single racial or religious group: Afghanistan, Iran, China, Pakistan, Egypt, etc.\n\nNo one claims it should exist just for Jews. It actually has more Muslims than any non-majority Muslim country. There are many people that have their own country not just the Jewish people. Palestinians want their own country, Kurds, etc. And as you said many people actually do have their own country. The Jews needed their own country even more because no other country in the region would tolerate the Jews.\n\n&gt;2. All Palestinians are terrorists who want to kill the Jews.\n\n&gt;make such a broad-sweeping claim is disingenuous to the issue at hand. Of course, there are some Palestinians who want to eradicate all the Jews, just as there are some Israelis who want to eradicate all the Palestinians (I say some, but in a conflict as large and ongoing as this, it's likely that \"most\" could be applied to both parties). But to say \"all\" feels like an attempt by those in power to sway the opinion of the people.\n\nNo one is saying all Palestinians want to kill Jews. Its the policy of the government. The Palestinians setup pay to slay laws, elect a government that actively engages in terrorist attacks against Jews, and teaches killing Jews in their schools. Israel actually prosecutes people for committing terror, and the family of people like Baruch Goldstein receive nothing.\n\n&gt;3. Palestinians started this conflict.\n\n&gt;The conflict started in 1917 when England established \"in Palestine... a national home for the Jewish people\" (Balfour Declaration, 1917) and was furthered in 1948 when Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion said, \"We must expel Arabs and take their places…and, if we have to use force...then we have force at our disposal.\" (Nur Masahla, Expulsion of the Palestinians, p. 66) During which, over 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from British-controlled Mandatory Palestine. Since then, Palestine's borders and population have been shrinking.\n\nI'm actually not familiar with that quote, but the Zionist completely expected Arabs to live with them in Israel, as the do today with more Arabs as a percentage than any non-Muslim nation. At the founding of Israel they were attacked on day one by the Arabs.\n\n&gt;4. This is the price of war.\n\n&gt;From October 7, 2023–November 19, 2025 Israel has endured 1,654 fatalities and 8,295 injuries while Palestine has endured 61,158 fatalities and 151,442 injuries (Statista, 2025). This hardly feels justifiable. I'd be more inclined to agree if the numbers were similar, but Palestine has experience nearly 21x more damage than Israel. It feels like indiscriminate killing. Not to mention that Gaza has been flattened and now the Palestinians are living in tents because their homes are unlivable.\n\nThe rules of proportionality applies to each military operations, which Israel considers on every operation. Palestine could have ended this war at any time by returning the hostages and removing Hamas from power. A similar request to the German after WW2. It's also important to note that Israelis have always put more values of the life of their citizens than Palestinians. Including trading over 1,000 Palestinians for 1 Israelis.",

One can make numerous arguments about the injustices done to their ancestors and go back and forth. But, that does not define the injustices of the current situation. What does a Palestinian farmhand in 1920 have to do with European Jews migrating over to seek restitution, whatever that means? It is true that the Zionist Movement sought land purchases, immigration, militarization with one possible goal of evicting Palestinians to have sufficient Jewish majority for a Jewish state. Leaders like Ben Gurion and Chaim Weizmann recognized this and lobbied for this (Paris Conference, Biltmore Conference etc.) The Jewish Militias *organized* in a massive scale and began sectarian violence in anticipation of the British Withdrawal (Village files project, Plan Dalet, Coastal clearing operations of 1948).\n4. This is not a complaint about Israel's strength. But one about the inhumanely disproportionate response. More than 70,000 documented dead.

Jewish immigration to the region started in the late 19th century, well before Balfour. Of course, they faced violence from local Arabs just like they had for a thousand+ years, because the Arabic Islamic world is both racially and religiously intolerant.

Who says that Israel is aiming for 100% Jews in the country? If it were aiming for such, why would they have given citizenship to all of the Arabs and Christians who stayed after the state was established and value them as citizens? I'm not arguing some of the laws need change and updating, but to posit what you did is patently false and cannot be proven accurate at all. The US is a nation built on Christianity and is still extremely Christian-centric, even classifying Christian holidays as 'federal' holidays. Does that mean the US aims to be a 100% Christian country? Do you seek to abolish the US borders entirely?\n2. I really don't think many informed people think this at all. Maybe some far-right wingers but most are pretty logical and reasonable about this.\n3. You have included a very selective telling of history. The conflict didn’t suddenly start in 1917.For centuries under the Ottoman Empire, there was never one unified “Palestinian Arab state.” Arab towns, tribes, and villages mostly governed themselves and lived independently of one another, and tensions already existed between them. Early Jewish communities legally bought land from Arab and Ottoman owners and lived on those plots. They weren’t taking over a single, cohesive Arab homeland they were settling on specific pieces of land they had purchased, alongside other independent communities. The Balfour Declaration also said the rights of Arabs *must* be protected. The Ben-Gurion quote is heavily disputed and doesn’t reflect any official policy. In 1948, the refugee crisis happened during a full regional war *after* Arab states rejected partition, some Palestinians fled, some were pushed out, and millions of Jews were also expelled from Arab countries. And Palestinians haven’t “shrunk”, their population has grown; the borders remain disputed because of wars and failed peace efforts. The real history is far more complicated than your cherry picked version.\n4. First off, people called it a genocide on October 8th, 2023 before a single Gazan had died from this war. So it's really hard to take this claim seriously without feeling like you all were going to call it a genocide even if 0 deaths had occurred. Second, you’re saying you’d feel better if the numbers were “more even.” That’s not how war works at all. Wars are never balanced. In World War II, far more Germans and Japanese civilians died than Americans or British. In the Gulf War, Iraqi losses were massively higher than US losses. In Syria’s civil war, most casualties were Syrians, not their foreign backers. Lopsided numbers don’t make a war moral or immoral, they just show that one side has different tactics and capabilities Treating it like a scorecard makes no logical sense.\n\nIt's not a game where you pick a side because they have cool jerseys or your favorite player or are the underdog. These are real human people and both sides deserve peace and sovereignty, not at the expense of the other.",

Obviously it's not *all* Palestinians, but you do need to look at percentage, and even more important, your definitions. The 7/10 massacre was carried out by several thousand terrorists, which, out of 2.1 million people living in Gaza seems like a minority. However, a survey that was done very shortly after the massacre among ordinary people of Gaza has shown that 80% of those surveyed supported it, and most of the 20% who opposed it cited the expected Israeli retaliation as their main concern. So, if you include all of those who want to see all Jews killed in the category of \"want to kill all the Jews\", then that claim is shockingly accurate.\n3. The borders of \"Palestine\" have never shrunk because it never existed. Before 1948 it was all under the British mandate. There were several Jewish settlements and several Arab settlements but most of the land was empty, with neither side having any stronger claim to it than the other. Then the Arabs rejected the 1947 UN partition plan and started the 1948 war, and lost. Between 1948 and 1967 the Gaza strip was occupied by Egypt and the West Bank was occupied by Jordan. It was never free nor independent. The first time Palestinians got any kind of self governance (even if partial) was in 1993, following the Oslo accords. And regarding the population - there are a lot more Palestinians living in Gaza and the West Bank today than there were in 1948, by orders of magnitude.\n4. The fact that one side is inferior in military strength does not automatically make it the righteous side. Real life isn't an anime or fantasy novel. War is nasty and people get killed; that's just how it is. You can't expect one side to endanger their own lives just to reduce the number of casualties on the enemy side. And by the way, that number you've mentioned has no proper backing other than the \"Gaza ministry of health\", which is controlled by Hamas. It's very likely to be artificially inflated (e.g. by including natural deaths) and even if it's accurate, Hamas' reports don't tell civilians and combatants apart. You don't know how many of those 61k presumably killed were actually Hamas terrorists, and I suspect it was well over 50%.",

I am *not* saying that \"Israel has no right to exist,\" but that Israel as a country established strictly for Jewish people has no right to exist. This claim is not catered for a Jewish state; I oppose any state that aims for its entire population to be that of a single racial or religious group: Afghanistan, Iran, China, Pakistan, Egypt, etc.\n\nIsrael does not strive to have all its citizens be Jewish. It always had a minority majority of Arabs, now about 20% of the population, and a variety of other, smaller ethnic groups. What Israel strives towards is maintaining a Jewish **majority**. It may seem like a nitpick or semantics, but there is a very big difference between the two. The reason behind this is that Jews, as a people, do not believe that it is possible for them to be a minority group, especially in the Middle East, without being subject to persecution.  \n\n&gt;All Palestinians are terrorists who want to kill the Jews.\n\nI think this is a disgusting statement, and I do not consider any Israeli who holds this opinion a person worth listening to. I dont think it is representative of what the majority of Israelis think, either. \n\n&gt;The conflict started in 1917 when England established \"in Palestine... a national home for the Jewish people\" (Balfour Declaration, 1917) and was furthered in 1948 when Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion said, \"We must expel Arabs and take their places…and, if we have to use force...then we have force at our disposal.\" (Nur Masahla, Expulsion of the Palestinians, p. 66) During which, over 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from British-controlled Mandatory Palestine. Since then, Palestine's borders and population have been shrinking.\n\nThe idea of even trying to ask \"who started it\" is a little silly to me. The problem here is that both peoples started it. Both Arabs and Jews had understandable reasons to fight each other in 1947. Jews had nowhere else to go, and refused to be a minority again, not after the Holocaust. Arab Palestinians lived in the land for generations, and did not want to leave it for other people, who were essentially foreigners. We can spend hours pointing into different events and saying \"this side started it!\" and we will always be right. Because they both did. Some conflicts happen for understandable reasons. \n\n&gt;This is the price of war.\n\nA half-truth. On one hand, this is a true statement. Hamas **did** start this war. Hamas **does** use tactics that endanger the civilian population of Gaza. Urban combat **is** notorious for the damage it causes, no matter how careful the participating actors are. On the other hand, Israel **does** have lucklaster targeting standards, **does** commit warcrimes, and **does** show a lack of care for the civilian population of Gaza. All of those things are true at the same time. So the \"price of war\" argument, simply put, does not work in all instances, it is not applicable for every situation. It is a surface-level observation that doesn't involve much thinking, after all, so it is expected.",

But this is the exact kind of nonsensical back and forths I'm talking about.\n\nI think you're being a little disingenuous although I appreciate that you've already acknowledged that Palestinians lived on the land for generations and didn't like it being taken from them.\n\nWorking out who started it is not nonsensical and in fact it's quite simple: to resist something (as you stated) implies that there is a thing happening first which subsequently undergoes resistance. Anyway the question under discussion here is \"who started it\" in modern history b/w Zionists and Palestinians, it's not about whether each side had understandable reasons for actions they took.\n\n\\&gt;And all actions of the Zionists were a reaction to European antisemitism, which included the Balfour declaration, btw. \n\nOK, so now you are agreeing with OP that the Balfour declaration started the current situation between Zionists and Palestinians :)? And sure you can say that Herzl's Zionism was partly a reaction to European antisemitism, but what does that have to do with Palestinians? Let's be reductive: *European antisemitism -&gt; Zionism  -&gt; Mass migration to Palestine to create Jewish-majority state incl. displacement of existing population*. Which action starts the conflict **specifically** between Zionists and Palestinians?\n\nNow again, the reason why it's important to make this distinction of \"who started it\" is that it informs justice and restitution.\n\n\\&gt;Let's see if you are able to see the other side in good faith, because I'm very much able to do this for the Palestinian-Arabs. If you were a European Jew in the 1920s-1930s, what would you do? What would you feel? What would you support?\n\nWho knows? Yes I very well understand the justifications Zionists used, doesn't change the facts of what they did though. And at any rate what I hypothetically think I would do is irrelevant to the question of who started it, and it's like me asking - \"If you were a non-Jew German in the 1930s and 1940s, what would you do?\" It doesn't change the facts that they committed and/or were complicit in atrocities, regardless of whatever reasons they had. When you commit war crimes, they're still war crimes even if you had 'reasons' to commit them",

    "body": "Wow! A good faith pro-palestine person. That feels quite rare. I'll be happy to engage if that's the case. Alright, let's cover this point by point:\n\n1)\n&gt; I don't believe an ethno-religious-state has a right to exist. I oppose any state that aims for its entire population to be that of a single racial or religious group\n\nIf this is a value that you hold, that's fine to have. However, I must point out 2 things here. The first is that you don't agree with ethno-religious states, but simultaneously are supporting the free palestine cause whose end goal is basically an ethno-religious state. That's a contradiction. The other thing is that Israel has never aimed for its entire population to be jewish. If that were true, then Israel's founding prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, wouldn't have offered citizenship to the arabs that stayed within Israel's armistice lines during its founding and declaration of independence in 1948.\n\n2)\n&gt; All Palestinians are terrorists who want to kill the Jews.\n\nThis is hyperbolic language used by very few people in the real world.\n\n3)\n&gt; Palestinians started this conflict. The conflict started in 1917 when England established \"in Palestine...a national home for the Jewish people\" (Balfour Declaration, 1917) and was furthered in 1948...\n\nPalestinian arab muslims DID start the conflict. This one is true. There's something disturbing about your point #3 and it's the fact that you started at 1917 and then skipped all the way to 1948. There's a gigantic omission of history there. There's a lot of important context and history in that 31 years in between. What that tells me, is that wherever you learned what you know about this conflict, that source was very selective about what history to share with you. No offense to you, but I find it to be incredibly common for pro-palestine people to only mention the history that's convenient for the palestine narrative.\nSo anyway, 1917 is a great place to start, but I would personally not consider it the start of the conflict. The Balfour Declaration was not official policy at that point in time, but rather it was a statement of intent by the Brits of what kind of future the area would have; That a portion of the mandate of palestine would be carved to make a jewish state. There was also an intention to carve an arab state for the hashemites, which became Jordan. Plus, the Balfour Declaration was explicitly clear that the intended jewish state wouldn't be only for jews. \n\n\"His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.\"\n\nIn my personal opinion, I would consider the start of the conflict to be where the first violence is located. So, who committed the first acts of aggression? This happened in 1920. In 1920, there were several massacres of jewish villages by mobs of arab muslims, including ancient jewish villages where jews have always lived. There were more massacres in 1921 and 1929 as well. And jews at this point hadn't stolen any land. They moved there legally and bought land. The jews responded to these massacres by forming militias to defend themselves from the pogroms. Some of these fighters go on to launch attacks on the muslims in the 30s and the conflict goes back and forth endlessly ever since then. THAT'S the real story and to this day, I've never heard even one pro-palestine person ever acknowledge the 20s. They always seem to just focus on the nakba.\n\n4)\n&gt; This is the price of war. From October 7, 2023--November 19, 2025 Israel has endured 1,654 fatalities and 8,295 injuries while Palestine has endured 61,158 fatalities and 151,442 injuries (Statista, 2025). This hardly feels justifiable.\n\n\"This hardly feels justifiable.\" This is a huge difference of worldview. Hamas doesn't have the moral high ground just because they're weaker and have more losses. War is not a game where both sides must have equal losses in order for it to be fair and just. Factions at war seek to be as strong as possible and minimize their losses as much as possible, not to be equal. The whole point is to win, ideally, as overwhelmingly as possible. Somewhere around almost half of those casulties are hamas militants and the majority of the rest are civilian casualties mainly on hamas' hands. It's not just due to their human sacrifice strategy; They have also sniped and shot down many of their own people throughout the war.",

    "body": "Okay, so, you're either being intentionally disingenuous or you've been fed a bullshit one-sided narrative and believe in it. You're taking the late 1800s land purchases and overly-simplifying them to merely being evictions. I can't imagine a more one-sided way to describe it than what you put. Furthermore, you're attributing this to being the primary reason for the start of the violence, which is also incorrect. You're attempting to provide context for violence and yet are only mentioning selective details while omitting crucial context on those details. Isn't that hypocritical in a way? Wouldn't that be indicative of someone pushing a narrative instead of presenting a fuller history? What's particularly telling about your response is that the only thing you had to say about the 20s is a reference to al aqsa. That relates to 1929's Hebron massacre, which is the most famous of all the 20s massacres. Why would that be even an appropriate place for you start in this particular conversation about first violence when that one occurs 9 years after the first violence?\n\nHere's what you're missing ---&gt; Jews from Europe started immigrating to the area by working with Ottoman leaders to obtain permission to enter the district of palestine. Jewish leaders also negotiated with ottoman leadership to obtain land grants and to purchase land. Outside of the ottoman government, it was wealthy absentee landowners from Istanbul that were very open to selling land. While it's true that some evictions happened, most of these purchases did not result in evictions displacing arabs. The idea that arabs were mass evicted from palestine during this time is a distortion of history. Evictions DID happen, but only in a portion of the purchases. The actual on-the-ground reality is that these land purchases were NEAR arab communities, rather than replacing them. Jewish farming communities erected fences around their jewish-owned part of the land, which changed the way arab farmers grazed their flocks. As far as those minority of evictions go, I would say most of the blame goes to the ottomans rather than jews. Ottoman land magnates sent agents across the empire to make deals with random villagers. They offered these people to pay the empire's famously convoluted taxes for them in exchange for just signing a contract. Most farmers didn't realize they were trading away ownership for tax relief. Most arabs didn't ever realize, sometimes for generations, that they didn't actually own their land. When it comes to the evictions, it's understandable from the arab perspective, since they believed they owned their land and were now being told someone else owns it somehow. This would look like theft to them. It's also understandable from the jewish perspective, that they legally bought land the correct way, from the rightful owners, only to see that there are people there. It's unfortunate, but that's the reality. A lot more nuanced, don't you think?\n\nAs for the first violence, this occurs in early 1920 in an outpost called Tel Chai, not because of zionist immigration, but because mobs of arabs were resisting french occupation. Tel Chai is close to the Syrian border and the rioters perceived the jewish settlement as being part of the french mandate of syria, but the jews were adamantly also resisting the french. They considered themselves as being part of the british empire because they wanted to be part of the jewish state that the Brits had promised to grant. This could have all been avoided if the arabs had at least chose to talk and investigate first before going and killing a bunch of jews in a force of hundreds. Even the nearby shias thought this was crazy and tried to help the jews. This provides context for Bnei Yehuda. About a month later, in April, during a muslim festival, a jewish parade occurred aimed at the british where they demanded a jewish defense arm of the police to be made. They didn't wanted to be the victims of pogroms any longer, like what had happened just a month earlier in Tel Chai (now Kiryat Shemona). This resulted in yet another massacre. During these Nebi Musa riots, muslims attacked jewish homes &amp; synagogues, raped, wounded many people, and killed others, including children. The people there were chanting \"Palestine is our land and the jews are our dogs.\" Jews were not seen as equal human beings, but more like sub-human. That's the reality for all non-muslims that lived under dimmi subjugation in ottoman times and in countless other muslim held places in the world to this very day. The skeleton of the conflict is islamic intolerance. There may be things added on to it over time; flesh on top of the skeleton. However, the skeleton is the core. If you remove the core, the flesh will just flop to the ground. The identification of this core would be very debatable if it was just this incident as evidence, but when we consider all of the events that have taken place from here all the way to 2026, it's overwhelmingly clear that that's the true core issue.\n\nOne thing of interest that I'd like to add is that antisemitic literature was translated into arabic in 1920 and brought to palestine, including parts of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion garbage that the Soviets made. I don't know whose responsible for this importation, or for the translation, or how big of a difference this made in influencing the conflict, but I wouldn't be surprised if the impact was large. It may be that once again, the Soviets are to blame. They were also responsible for 1967, which would lead to the west bank situation that we have today.",

Sure, there are some more extreme Israelis that argue something like that, just like there's many pro-Palestinians who argue that all Israelis are illegitimate \"settlers\", if not outright murderers, rapists and \"genociders\". But obviously, this isn't some core \"pro-Israeli\" argument. You can be very pro-Israeli, like me, and not believe in it. \n\n&gt; and was furthered in 1948 when Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion said, \"We must expel Arabs and take their places…and, if we have to use force...then we have force at our disposal.\"\n\nThat one's simply a lie. Ben Gurion wrote the exact opposite, in his letter to his son (in 1936, not 1948): \"we *do not* want to expel the Arabs and take their place\". The error comes from ignoring part of the previous line that's scribbled out (\"we do not want and we do not\"), which mistakenly inverts the meaning of the sentence. But that mistake was already corrected by the early 2000's, so there's no justification to repeat it today. Furthermore, the rest of the context shows a complete opposite point - which you've dishonestly disguised with those elisions. The actual quote is (translated from the original Hebrew):\n\n&gt; We do not want and we do not need to expel Arabs and take their place, our aspiration is built on an assumption - that has been proven correct throughout our activity in the land - that there's enough room for us and the Arabs in the land, and if we need to use force - not in order to dispossess the Arabs of the Negev or\nTransjordan, but in order to guarantee our right to settle there - our force will allow us to do so.\n\nNow, if your inversion of the quote supposedly proves the pro-Palestinians are correct - would you concede that the fact it's fake, and says the complete opposite, proves the pro-Israelis correct? Or at the very least, make you start questioning a cause, that relies on such blatant forgeries? \n\n&gt; Since then, Palestine's borders and population have been shrinking.\n\nThe population of Palestine from the river to the sea is x5 of what it was in 1948. Even within Israel proper, where the 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from, it's nearly tripled, to over 2 million people. It didn't just not \"shrink\", it increased at one of the fastest rates in the world, far faster than Israel's own population. Again, you believe in something that's literally the opposite of reality.\n\nAs for the \"borders of Palestine shrinking\", I'm not even sure what you mean by those \"borders\". The British Mandate of Palestine was dissolved in 1948, so I guess you could argue its borders \"shrunk\" to nothing. From that point on, for forty years, no political entity called \"Palestine\" was formed, on any part of the land, including the parts occupied by the Arab states. But in 1988 the State of Palestine declared independence, and has mostly been gaining, not losing, land ever since. Whatever limited rule the Palestinians have in Gaza and Area A of the West Bank, is literally the most territory the Palestinian Arabs have ever ruled in history. The first time they  actually lost territory, rather than gaining it, is (potentially!) in this current war, and the current arrangement that splits Gaza in two. Finally, if by \"borders of Palestine\" you mean the geographic term of Palestine, according to which Israel is still \"occupied Palestine\" - they obviously never shrunk, or could shrink, even in theory. \n\nAgain, if that's the basis for your position, would that mean you'll reconsider it, once it's proven false?",

That means you support, even if you don't realize it, a far more exclusionary, ethnocratic and downright racist ethno-nationalist movement than Zionism ever was. And a country whose constitution and national charter defines its legitimate population as exclusively Arab (along with, possibly, a tiny, largely theoretical handful, of sufficiently \"Arab\", pre-Zionist Jews), and its laws based on the Islamic Shari'a. Where even the moderates insist that for Palestine to be \"free\", it has to be a racially pure Arab ethnostate, and roughly half a million Jews that live there must all be ethnically cleansed. Even the chant \"from the river to the sea\" in Arabic doesn't end with Palestine being \"free\", but with it being \"Arab\". And the flag they're waving, doesn't represent some kind of multiculturalism, but the flag of the Arab rebellion, representing the various invading Arab empires.\n\nOf course, you can still argue that what *you* believe in is something completely different... well, that means you're not \"pro-Palestinian\". You're pro something that Palestinians absolutely don't want, and goes against the core values of the Palestinian liberation movement. And if that's your schtick, you might as well argue you're *already* \"pro-Israeli\". After all, Israel, and the Zionist movement in general, is already far closer to the multi-cultural, civic nationalist ideals you hold, than anything the Palestinians have created, or want to create in the future. \n\n&gt; I oppose any state that aims for its entire population to be that of a single racial or religious group: Afghanistan, Iran, China, Pakistan, Egypt, etc.\n\nFirst of all, as I said, Israel, unlike Palestine, doesn't \"aim\" to be that at all. It always intended having a non-Jewish minority, from Herzl's Altneuland to the Israeli declaration of independence. It's population is 20% Palestinian Arab, a thousand times more than the number of Jews left in the Arab world, and the idea of expelling them is too extreme even for far-right politicians to express openly - if only because that would be grounds for barring them from the Knesset (as was the case with Kahane).\n\nSecond, of all the countries you mentioned, only the officially Arab Egypt is (sort of) an ethnic nation-state. The rest are various shades of oppressive and occasionally racist, but technically civic nation-states. You might argue that China is a de-facto ethnic nation-state, and a pretty racist one at that, but it's officially defined as a multicultural Communist state. Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, are not just officially, but also de-facto multi-ethnic states. With the Islamic Republic being more multicultural and non-Persian than liberal, secular Iranians that want to overthrow it, would want. They're theocratic, something Israel *isn't*, but they aren't officially defined as the national homeland of a specific ethnicity or ethnoreligious group. \n\nIf you actually want to bring equivalents to Israel, it would be something like Armenia, Latvia, Greece, and as I already mentioned, Palestine. Countries specifically created to be the expression of the inalienable Right of Self Determination of Peoples for a specific ethnic or national group. And I've yet to see a single pro-Palestinian oppose their existence. Even the most liberal civic nationalist Americans believe that replacing the officially civic nationalist Soviet Union with multiple ethnic nation-states, along with the more general concept of the Right of Self Determination, was an actively good thing - not even a neutral one.\n\nI think that, like many people who talk about this, you don't have a very clear idea of even what you're opposing or supporting. I've [written a post a while back, just for people like you](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1cqfdjl/ethnostates_ethnic_nationalism_and_israelpalestine/): ethnic vs. civic nationalism, \"ethnostate\" vs \"ethnocracy\" vs ethnic-nation-state, the Right of Self Determination of Peoples, etc.",

On the face of it, yes, they're a service provided to men only; but no, of course they aren't, it's disingenuous to decontextualise the existence of women's toilets too. There's a state earmarked for Jews -- on the face of it that's discriminatory, but only if you decontextualise the fact that there are other states where any other nation can thrive. In principle, Jews should be as content to be a minority in pluralist societies as say the Assyrians are here in Australia, but historically that hasn't always worked out.\n\n2.\n\nOf course not all are, not any newborn babies at a bare minimum. But a similar sentiment might be that if there are any peace-loving Gazans, they sure aren't making a lot of noise. For any given operation, only an idiot wouldn't assume any given passerby is likely to be hostile. You still shouldn't shoot without confirmation they're a threat, but you wouldn't let your guard down and you might do a compromise like pre-emptively arresting everyone and releasing them after.\n\n3.\n\nI don't think it's fair to characterise Balfour as an act of war, certainly not by the Jews since it was a British declaration, and if you like ancient history that much I don't think it's fair to skip over the Nebi Musa and Jaffa riots and the rest of the intercommunal conflict. But I don't think \"He started it\" is a great justification in general; I think \"He's still doing it *and refuses to de-escalate*\" is. We could debate whether any of Israel's peace offers were sincere or good enough, but my take is that they would be with some haggling, whereas I don't characterise any of Palestine's (PA's, Hamas's, PLO's) offers as being peace offers at all.\n\n4.\n\nHamas continued hostilities (in the form of holding hostages until recently, and now violating ceasefire lines); ought they have the right to do so? Why does your solution to the bloodshed not include \"They should stop doing so\"? Are they entitled to some minimum kill:death ratio? Do you think they would de-escalate if they had internationally-backed stop loss insurance? I'd agree that 60k is excessive for revenge, but clearly it isn't to neutralise Hamas: do you think revenge is a righteous goal but defending one's people is not? Yeah, 60k is an awful lot, but it's really hard to say war should have a price cap without causing serious problems.",

Ceding power to Arabs on 100% of the land would not be fair to native Jews. Ceding power to Jews on 100% of the land would not be fair to native Jews. They split it 85%-15%.

I personally would prefer ethnostates or ethnic based states did not exist, but I also wish I were handsomer and better at basketball. We have to deal with reality in that tribalism and ethnic-based states, including Palestine, are the norm. Being a minority has, for most of Jewish history, been a terrible experience. Being *any* minority in the Middle East is a precarious position (see, e.g., Yazidis). If that weren't the case, Zionism would never have emerged. Without genocidal antisemitism, there would never have been an 'ought' or a need for a \"Jewish State.\"\n\n&gt;All Palestinians are terrorists who want to kill the Jews\n\nWho makes such an argument? That's silly and untrue.\n\n&gt;The conflict started in 1917 when England established \"in Palestine... a national home for the Jewish people\" (Balfour Declaration, 1917)\n\nWell yes. Quite understandably, Palestine's Arabs, who were beginning to have a national consciousness, did not want the character of the country to be changed, without their consent, through mass immigration of Jews (or anyone else). But you should recognize that we can all play \"start the clock\" at a different time. One could argue that, since Palestine itself is the product of an imperial project - the Arab-Islamic conquests - the Jews, the last people to have an independent polity there - could claim this was illegitimate. Palestine in 1917 had about 600,000 -700,000 people - not empty, not \"a land without a people\" by any stretch, but not densely populated, this was especially true in the lowland areas where most Jewish settlement took place. And, in 1917, Palestine's border as we know it was not yet drawn - claims were made that it was a natural part of Syria (a much larger land mass). To the Jews, desperate for a home and refuge, there was plenty of room. The analogy given was a life-raft with room for 3 - if someone is in the life raft and another person is drowning in the water, the person drowning cannot get in the raft and then throw the 2 other people in the ocean. However, it would also be unjust for the two people not to make room for the 1 who would otherwise drown.\n\nJews and Palestinians did not understand each other from the outset. Jews saw plenty of space and an Arab world that stretched from the Atlantic to the Persian Gulf. That \"the Arabs\" couldn't share a tiny fraction of it, seemed like rank antisemitism. Palestinians thought more locally - this was their neighborhood, it had an Arab character for generations, upon generations, and here come foreigners trying to change things against the will of the current majority. It's possible to concede that both are, at least in an honest and subjective way, correct.\n\n&gt;From October 7, 2023–November 19, 2025 Israel has endured 1,654 fatalities and 8,295 injuries while Palestine has endured 61,158 fatalities and 151,442 injuries (Statista, 2025). This hardly feels justifiable.\n\nThere's *a lot* you could argue about the devastation in Gaza and the injustice or horror of it. It isn't at all difficult to make the pro-Palestinian argument on this one. But this ain't it. You can't just make moral judgements based on body counts. The US in WW2 killed something like 800,000+ Japanese civilians. I'm not sure if more than a handful of US civilians were killed at Pear Habor. Would one therefore conclude that the US was the villain of WW2?",

Also why almost all Mizrahi Jews ended up in Israel after their expulsion from the Arab world (basically nowhere else to go).\n\nNow, I believe the land is for both the Jews AND the Palestinians. My personal take on history is that Palestinian Nationalism rejects the idea that the Jews need a national home, utterly rejects the Jews connection to the land, and opposed the influx of Jews into the land as it would have affected the cultural makeup of the land (basically classic anti immigration stances). From this violence erupted because Palestinians rejected the influx of Jews and because the Jews had nowhere else to go.\n\nThere should be a way for the land to be shared: for Jews to have a national home and security and for the Palestinians to have the same.

Of course not all of them are.\n3. It started before that. I think you may want to look into Dhimmi status, the Ottoman abolishment of it in the 1850s, and how the Muslim population responded. It's fairly similar to how the US south responded to emancipation, which also resulted in a civil war. By 1917 Jews had already purchased a huge amount of land in the area and there were already attacks against them.\n   1. As for that Ben-Gurion quote, I think you need to read some more about it. Context matters so much at that point in time: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937\\_Ben-Gurion\\_letter#Disputed\\_text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937_Ben-Gurion_letter#Disputed_text)\n   2. Essentially, the quote may actually say the opposite. But that doesn't really matter. Benny Morris writes:\n\n&gt;elsewhere, in unassailable statements, Ben-Gurion at this time repeatedly endorsed the idea of 'transferring' (or expelling) Arabs, or the Arabs, out of the area of the Jewish state-to-be, either 'voluntarily' or by compulsion. There were good reasons for Ben-Gurion's endorsement of transfer: The British Peel Commission had proposed it, the Arabs rebelling in Palestine were bent on uprooting the Zionist enterprise, and the Jews of Europe, under threat of destruction, were in dire need of a safe haven, and Palestine could not serve as one so long as the Arabs were attacking the Yishuv and, as a result, the British were curtailing Jewish access to the country.\n\nAnd point 4) The difference in casualty numbers is irrelevant and I see it as a rather superficial point to make. It may \"feel\" like indiscriminate killing to you, but that doesn't mean it was. It is the result of a difference in military tactics and prioritization of life. Israel has taken huge steps over decades to protect its population. Hamas has done the opposite - they have embedded within and underneath its population in order to use them as a tool to de-legitimize Israel.\n\nYour train of thought is exactly as Hamas designed. They wanted to make themselves such a large threat that Israel would be forced to go after them, at which point they would use the people of Gaza as fodder and blast the casualty numbers to the world to smear the IDF. You see the destruction of Gaza, which is huge and the vast majority of the area. Yet, about 3.5% of the population was killed. That includes militant deaths, which, by design, they never distinguish, as well as some proven cases of natural deaths not related to the war. This is also a stated policy of Hamas. That would not be possible if there was indiscriminate killing. Even the worst estimate for the civilian to militant death ratio puts the war at about average for urban conflict. It is far more likely that the ratio was much lower than average, even though Hamas used human shields *literally* all the time.\n\nI also want to point out that Hamas liberally uses IEDs which often injure or kill Palestinians as well. They are truly dumb, indiscriminate weapons. All of those numbers are counted against Israel too.",

Lets be serious here, Israel hit almost every single building in Gaza.\n\nWe have plenty of IDF soldiers testimonies that they blew up buildings for fun.\n\n[https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240323-israeli-soldiers-blowing-up-homes-in-gaza-for-amusement/](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240323-israeli-soldiers-blowing-up-homes-in-gaza-for-amusement/)\n\n[https://www.un.org/unispal/document/unosat-gaza-strip-damage-assessment-31oct25/](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/unosat-gaza-strip-damage-assessment-31oct25/)\n\n&gt;hat includes militant deaths, which, by design, they never distinguish, as well as some proven cases of natural deaths not related to the war\n\nA lot of natural deaths are directly related to the war. Israel blockades on food and medicine obviously aggravated the pre-existing fragilities of people.\n\n&gt;They wanted to make themselves such a large threat that Israel would be forced to go after them, at which point they would use the people of Gaza as fodder and blast the casualty numbers to the world to smear the IDF\n\nYoure acting like the IDF was forced by Hamas to kill 20k children. It wasnt. It chose to disregard civilian casualties in its pursuit of Hamas members.\n\n[https://www.savethechildren.net/news/gaza-20000-children-killed-23-months-war-more-one-child-killed-every-hour](https://www.savethechildren.net/news/gaza-20000-children-killed-23-months-war-more-one-child-killed-every-hour)\n\n&gt;Hamas used human shields *literally* all the time\n\nCivilian being near Hamas members are not human shields, unless Hamas fighters are currently operating. You wouldnt argue that off-duty IDF soldiers are using human shields when going to the supermarket, would you?\n\nSame goes for Hamas outside of their fighting.\n\nIll add that the IDF is also a big user of human shields.\n\n[https://www.btselem.org/topic/human\\_shields](https://www.btselem.org/topic/human_shields)\n\n[https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-intel-revealed-israeli-officials-discussing-use-of-human-shields-in-gaza-sources-say/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-intel-revealed-israeli-officials-discussing-use-of-human-shields-in-gaza-sources-say/)\n\n&gt;Even the worst estimate for the civilian to militant death ratio puts the war at about average for urban conflict\n\nActually, most studies estimates that 75 to 85% of death are civilians. Thats a truly awful civilian to combattants ratio, way worse than Mosul where ISIS literally filled building with civilians.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties\\_of\\_the\\_Gaza\\_war#Civilian\\_to\\_combatant\\_ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Gaza_war#Civilian_to_combatant_ratio)",

Why should Israel not be a Jewish state?Africa: Saudi Arabia, Iran (Shia), Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan, Egypt, Algeria, Iraq, Oman, Yemen, UAE, Qatar, Libya, Tunisia, Morocco are all Muslim states. So when they denounce Islam as their national religion or Christian countries in Europe and Latin America do, then get back to me on this. Stop pretending this is an issue. It's clearly anti-semitic rhetoric because other nations have national religions. It doesn't mean those are the only people allowed to live in the nation and its the same in Israel.\n\n2. I don't know anybody that honestly thinks all Palestinians are terrorists and want to kill them, it's more along the lines of if the majority of Palestinians had their way, then the Jewish state would cease to exist and the Jews would have to leave. That doesn't provide them a place to go. The majority of Israelis now have been born there. Where should they go? The idea that Palestinians would want to kill them came from the 1940's Nakba/Independence war. I mean when the secretary General of the Arab League says its going to be a war of extermination spoken on the levels of Genghis Khan... that leaves little to interpret on intent....\n\n3. You're skipping TONS of conflict and I'm hoping you're being genuine or this is pointless. There were close to a dozen attacks on Jews by Arabs of the region before the Jews even attacked back in the 1920s also:\n\nPrior to partition plan, Palestinian Arabs did not view themselves as having a separate identity. When the First Congress of Muslim-Christian Associations met in Jerusalem in February 1919 to choose Palestinian representatives for the Paris Peace Conference, the following resolution was adopted:\n\nWe consider Palestine as part of Arab Syria, as it has never been separated from it at any time. We are connected with it by national, religious, linguistic, natural, economic and geographical bonds.\n\nIn 1937, a local Arab leader, Auni Bey Abdul-Hadi, told the Peel Commission, which ultimately suggested the partition of Palestine: \"There is no such country as Palestine! 'Palestine' is a term the Zionists invented! There is no Palestine in the Bible. Our country was for centuries part of Syria.\"\n\nThe representative of the Arab Higher Committee to the United Nations submitted a statement to the General Assembly in May 1947 that said \"Palestine was part of the Province of Syria\" and that, \"politically, the Arabs of Palestine were not independent in the sense of forming a separate political entity.\" A few years later, Ahmed Shuqeiri, later the chairman of the PLO, told the Security Council: \"It is common knowledge that Palestine is nothing but southern Syria.\"\n\nPalestinian Arab nationalism is largely a post-World War I phenomenon that did not become a significant political movement until after the 1967 Six-Day War and Israel's capture of the West Bank.\n\n4. Hamas started this war on 10/7. Devastation and casualties in war doesn't make you the victim. Japan attacked the USA and got them involved in world War 2. The US then fire bombed and nuked Japan twice killing far more Japanese civilians than American civilians died during the war. Germany invaded other nations in WW2, but how did that end up for those German civilians in Dresden? It doesn't make Germany more righteous. If you had the power and the weapons to protect your people and you have enemies north east and south of you, would you be using those weapons regularly? Why would Israel endanger their people instead of using their weapons?  \n\nI personally don't think anybody should be killed. In 2005 Gaza had elections. They elected a group with a genocidal part to their charter. The PA had the Martyr's Fund. Why should Israel lay down its defenses and why should they endanger their people?",

Except for a few minor religious matters, and its holidays being Jewish, there's no meaningful discrimination. The same cannot be said for actual ethno-states in the region like Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, which favor their Muslim majorities.\n\nThis is a classic Marxist slur and lie intended to legitimatize Israel. To remove Israel's Jewish nature and allow the unlimited return of the DESCENDANTS of actual Palestinian refugees would almost instantly lead to the expulsion, murder or vicious subjugation of its Jews (and all other non-Muslim minorities), as happened in Gaza and literally every Arab country.\n\n2 - No, but most Palestinians support Palestinian terrorists and their efforts to murder Israelis and destroy Israel. Poll after poll shows this. Classic straw man.\n\n3 - The conflict started in 1920 when local Arabs, not to refer to themselves as Palestinians for another 44 years, started murdering local Jews, because they were Jews, and their growing numbers threatened them somehow. Eventually Jews fought back, and to blame them for doing that is disingenuous and insane, supporting the view that people only like Jews when they're dead or helpless. Sorry, that ended in 1920, and will never return.\n\n4 - I partly agree with you here. I think the war was too brutal and long and could have been waged differently. But even if it had and only half as many civilians had dies (obviously the death of terrorists was not a bad thing, they chose to become terrorists and paid the price for it), you folks would still have accused Israel of the deliberately chosen blood libel of genocide. Plus, Hamas started it, not Israel. And no, it was in no way, shape or form legitimate \"resistance\"--and then to Israel's existence.\n\nSorry, yours is a tired and worn script posed in a disingenuous \"Oh I'm just asking questions\" manner. Jews legally purchased, settled and developed tracts of land on their ancestral homeland, the international community decided to grant them a modestly-sized country for their troubles and their legitimate claims, and the world's 2 billion Muslims and 400 million Arabs, possessing over 50 countries spanning vast tracts of land that dwarf Israel, have never been able to accept that, like an elephant terrified of a mouse.

In theory, Israel isn’t anything different, although because Jews are threatened worldwide Israel also works for general Jewish wellbeing globally. The main “purpose” of Israel outside being the place where Jews self-determine is to keep them safe, which it more or less has. Also, contrary to what many sources might say, Israel doesn’t necessarily have to be “Jewish only”. It’s a state for Jews like Germany is for Germans, but not only for them.\n\n2- Not a point I’d ever make. Kinda absurd tbh I have heard very few people echo the same sentiment.\n\n3- Pretty general statement. The Arabs started the armed conflict by attacking Jewish settlements first, during the mandatory period and 1948 war. Both sides planned mass expulsions, and one side a full-fledged genocide. The war itself started with an Arab attack on May 15th. You can’t sum all of this up neatly.\n\n4- Firstly, I’m not sure I agree with the statement at all. But I will address the points you mentioned related to it:\n\nThe idea that the war’s justification is annulled because of factors that occur through it is bizarre to me. The war started because of an active threat and attack on Israeli civilians. Israel figured that it needed to eliminate Hamas completely to ensure that it wouldn’t happen again. This was non-negotiable. It’s a bigger undertaking and wildly different battle than the October 7th attacks, so it’s going to have different results. October 7th attacks lasted 2 days or so. The war was 2 years long. Figures the results would be different, no? The justification still stands.\n\n&gt;If the numbers were equal\n\nWar doesn’t have to be equal. WW2 saw a very unequal casualty rate. The rates are created by many factors like technological superiority, manpower, density, etc. In this case, it’s overwhelmingly in the favour of Israel and not Hamas or the Palestinians.",

Israelite refered to the people who were from there in ye olden times. Judea is a region there, and is the etymological origin of the word Jew. \n\n\nJewish could mean a follower of Judaism, or an ethnic Jew. Not all ethnic Jews practice the religion. And not all practicing Jews were born Jewish (in fact, disproportionately they weren't). But conversion to Judaism is a years-long process akin to naturalization, not getting sprinkled with water and saying you like Oily Josh, or whatever quick and easy process Islam takes that historically Muslims have been able to get Jews executed by saying \"oh, this person secretly and privately converted to Islam\" and then they're declared apostates and executed when they deny it. \n\n\nYes, this has actually happened. Why you would want these sort of people to control... Literally anything at all is beyond me. Why you think Jews should tolerate it, only you can explain. If someone tried to do that to me, I wouldn't pity them after they died. I'd seriously question the morality of anyone who did. \n\n\nI'd especially question the morality of someone arguing that the fact that they got themselves and their \"loved ones\" killed in order to enslave me means they clearly deserved to enslave me in the first place. ",

But it seems like most “pro-Palestinian people” are anti-Israel. They want Israel gone. Which places an existential threat against Israel and makes people who support Israel in turn frustrated by pro Palestinians. I’m very confused as to why anyone is “pro-Palestinian” and not “pro peace for both Palestinians and Israelis.” Israel has come to the bargaining table so many times but they’ve yet to have a reasonable non terrorist party on the other side of the table to negotiate with. \n\nSometimes I feel like the pro Palestinian folks have never read a history book, have no idea what they’re supporting, and get their news from TikTok. You’d think Israel was taking over the world, rather than a speck of insignificant dust in the middle of a MASSIVE Arab colonization and expulsion. Yikes.\n\nIt also amazes me the folks like OP who “don’t believe in ethno religious states” yet have no idea what this means or any issue with again the massive Arab ethno religious states. They claim issues with Israel yet make no issue about any of those Arab states infringing upon women’s rights. They don’t attempt to blame Hamas for the problems of the Palestinian people despite Israel leaving Gaza in 2005. Also, Palestine is seeking an ethno religious state, and even though Arabs and Christian’s live in Israel, Jews and Christian’s would not be welcome in Palestine. So you don’t support ethno religious states, but you do for Palestine? Explain the contradiction to me because the math doesn’t make sense. You literally said you are pro something for Palestine but anti that same thing for Israel. \n\n“The conflict started…” again with misinformation.\n\nComparisons of fatalities is also massively flawed. Israel has sustained fewer casualties because of the iron dome and better protection of its people. Hamas and Iran who backs Hamas do not care at all about the Palestinians. In fact, Palestinians dying is more ammo for them to show the world how bad Israel is. They build tunnels and operations in schools and hospitals. No other country would paper entire areas and warn people to leave, but Israel did. \n\nBeing pro Palestinian, for those who truly are, isn’t about being anti Israel, it’s about being anti Hamas, anti Iran, anti terrorism, and PRO PEACE with Israel. The empty virtue signaling of free Palestine at Israel’s expense does absolutely nothing for Palestinians. Anyone who is not seeking peace and normalization of relations does not truly care about Palestinians.",

The Balfour declaration was repudiated by the UK in 1930 with the Palestine White Paper, which placed strict restrictions on Jewish immigration and on Jewish purchasing of land. During the 1948 war, which started when the combined forces of 7 Arab countries invaded Israel, Palestinian populations were urged by the invading Arabs to flee Palestine, with the promise that it would be temporary and that they could return to their homes after the Jews were defeated and killed. Whoever told you Palestine's population has been shrinking has lied to you. The Palestinian population has only ever grown over time. There are far more Palestinians today than there were in 1948. Tangentially, by contrast the Jewish population today is still smaller than it was in 1930.  \n4. Far more Germans were killed in WWII than Americans or Brits. German cities like Berlin were flattened just as much as Gaza. Surely no one would imply that because Germany suffered more casualties, that Germany was the victim.

The fact that the Central Elections Committee voted 28 to 5 to ban Kach specifically because it was racist and anti-democratic really shows how different things used to be. You’re right to feel uneasy, because we’ve gone from Likud actively pushing to ban these people to Netanyahu playing a central role in bringing their ideas into the political mainstream just to hold together a governing coalition.\n\nSadly, the numbers support your concern about how fast this shift has happened. In the 2022 elections, the Religious Zionism alliance, which includes and protects these Kahanist ideas, didn’t barely make it into parliament, they became the third largest party in the Knesset with 14 seats and close to 11% of the total vote. That means a large part of the public openly supported ideas that were legally considered too extreme and dangerous to even be allowed in parliament just thirty years ago. Seeing Ben Gvir go from a young activist convicted of inciting racism to becoming the National Security Minister in charge of the police represents a deep structural change, not just a temporary political moment.\n\nIt really feels like what used to be called the “fringe” is no longer on the sidelines; it now holds real power. When senior government ministers openly align themselves with Kahane’s ideology and control both the West Bank administration and the police, the more pragmatic and restrained Likud of the 1980s is basically gone. Making this kind of ethnic supremacy and messianic authoritarian thinking seem normal is deeply isolating and pushes away a huge portion of the Jewish diaspora, many of whom cannot square their values with a government that openly embraces these ideas.",

    "body": "It frightens me too and whilst I agree with your post, I have an even more pessimistic explanation for the rise. \n\nBasically, I think Kahanism is the logical point for a society built on ethnic superiority founded with the ethnic cleansing of the indigenous population. \n\nYou can arrive on the land with grand ideals about socialism, liberalism and democracy, but pretty soon they are going to come into conflict with main project of zionism, that being the displacement of one ethnic group and the creation of a state for another. \n\nWe saw that in a microcosm with the socialist settlers. They came to the land with the idea of emancipating all workers through unionisation and worker democracy, but that came into conflict with Avoda Ivrit, the idea of Hebrew Labour. They try and square the circle and create separate Arab labour unions, but that doesn't work as they still need to control them, and by the time 1948 comes around, socialist groups were some of the greediest groups for taking expropriated Arab land. Zeev Sternhell's book is really required reading on this topic I think. \n\nSimilar story with the centre-left liberal ruling Ashkenazi elite of Israel over the last few decades. They bend themselves into pretzels trying to solve the incompatibility of Israel being both a Jewish state and a liberal secular democracy, and then fall prey to the more radical religious elements within that say... why try and be both? The Jewish state part is far more important to us, so let's drop the pretense and just focus on that. \n\nOf course the elite of Israel have themselves to blame for another key reason too - namely the way they treated the Mizrahim who they brought in to Israel after they arrived. It's no coincidence that the far right Israeli parties find their base of support among poorer Misrahi communities, just due to the elitism and let's be honest overt racism shown toward them by the richer and more educated European elites. \n\nIt's a shift that I think is only going to get worse in the coming decades. We've already seen mass emigration out of Israel since Oct 7 because living in a nation at war is not an appealing life to most people who have options. The people leaving tend to be richer more educated and more liberal Israelis with dual nationality, which causes the remaining Israeli society to shift further to the right. This then further alienates Israel from Jews living in the west, which means it becomes more reliant on Christian fundamentalists and right wing despots for support, etc. \n\nIt's a pretty bleak picture and I share your worry. Obviously the rightward shift isn't just an Israeli phenomenon, but the specific characteristics of Israel may make it much more damaging there than in other places.",

They are very intentionally benefiting from violence, or in what violence makes available to them (influence, customers, resources, assets—e.g. land).",

Diaspora Judaism: Modern Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, Reconstructionist...  does offer an alternative, but Israelis as a people, including in decades past, never took to it.  Given that Israel puts so much stake in \"Jewish\", something has to fill that void.  Neo-Zionism for all its flaws is at least a religion of a free people.  \n\n2.  Israel has a decidedly populist culture.  The Israeli Left, the professional class, is not comfortable in their own skin.  Netanyahu's views of them, and their own inability to come up with a present-day national vision, have gotten into their head.  \n\n3.

Half the population want a Social Democratic European State just in the Middle East not Europe; half the population wants a Middle Eastern state just with Judaism in place of Islam.  Netanyahu's \"traitor\" label has stuck.  Not just with a percentage of the public but in their own heads.    Because Europe is often acting against Israel's interest it is harder to defend the connections with Europe, the West. The core of what they are fighting for are Western values the former vision.  But in their mind, Europe defines Western values, and if those values are anti-Israel, they are traitorous.  \n\nThis is what I meant by not comfortable in their own skin.  \n\nThe next most serious problem, the underlying reason for the problem above is that Oslo failed.  The Palestinians didn't negotiate in good faith.  The Israeli Left hasn't really unified around what to do if there won't be negotiated peace.  They can't put this issue to bed until they convince Israelis they have either changed their position or their old position was right and it was just bad circumstances (i.e., Iran, for example).  And this goes deeper because for most of them they themselves don't believe the failure was circumstance, rather they were wrong about the single most important issue of the last 2 generations. \n\nAnd they can't duck this.  More deeply what the Left wants probably means an increase in deaths from terrorism even if it were to work.  To sell this policy they have to be willing to stand up and say, yes the excess deaths are worth it.  Which is Zionism, but they themselves aren't sure anymore. \n\nThey were also wrong about Communism.  Back in the 1930s what became Herut then Likud tilted market while what became Labour tilted Socialist and Communist.  The Left doesn't want to live on a Kibbutz either.  \n\nThey see themselves as Israel, but as a percentage of the population they have been shrinking since 1950.  They can't decide if they are an influential, wealthy population faction or the dominant population.  They obviously aren't the later objectively, but they haven't gotten that.  They are generally educated professional class.  Leftwing parties don't like being the Moderate Republican party, same issue the Democrats are having as they absorb more Never Trump Republicans and lose working class whites.  \n\nThat gets compounded by a total inability to unify around leadership.  Unlike the Right which has had Netanyahu for a generation, and when not Netanyahu Sharon.   The Left undercut one another rather than build one another up.  This makes it easy to unify around \"anti-Netanyahu\" but then they stand for nothing else.  Which makes people not see them as an alternative ...",

He will certainly not win, but if he will actually be in office he can get a serious position and have enough seats to do something with it. Or at least become a major opposition leader. He is strong, clear, and has vision. Unlike the previous leftist politicians. Some of whom I voted for and yet still struggle to recall their names.",

A few factors led to the changes we see now: 1) the 1967 war and the capture of historical biblical territories which galvanized the messianic religious Zionists and the settler movement who were extremely tiny previous; 2) the imports of 800,000 Jews from the Middle-East and North Africa in the 1950s that were not treated very well who ended up hating the Labour party and voting for Likud in the 1977 elections; 3) the failure of Oslo, the 2nd intifada and suicide bombs in the late 90s and early 2000s.\n\nIsrael's liberal leaders I would say are the former generals Gadi Eisenkot and Yair Golan, but they don't have enough support to actually beat Netanyahu in the election. Israeli society has shifted so right-wing that former right-wing extremists like Naftali Bennett and Avigdor Lieberman are seen as center moderates.\n\nTom Segev, the prominent Israeli historian, wrote a fantastic article in Haaretz a few months ago basically saying the old liberal elite consists of 200,000 people in Tel-Aviv who protest and desire for the old Israel, but are slowly dying out...this is what I see as well.\n\nSEGEV - \n\n\"I found myself at a demonstration on Azza Street, near the grocery store where I shop. And it occurred to me that 200,000 people – that's what there is. The nation is not divided and not torn. There is no parity between \\[the numbers of\\] supporters and opponents of the regime coup. The nation supports Netanyahu. Who doesn't support him? The 200,000 people who are defending their status as an obsolete elite.\n\n\"There won't be a civil war,\" he continues, \"because the demonstrators will not bring about a war and the other side in any case constitutes the majority. And as far as that goes, Israeli democracy was never real. For 20 years all the Arabs \\[in Israel\\] were under martial law, and then came the Six-Day War, and thereafter the entire population there \\[in the territories\\] was under that form of regime.\"",

Iran does fund Hamas and it becomes a dilemma of whether or not Hamas can sustain itself or protect against the occupation without the help of foreign countries. But I’m consistent with my beliefs and Iran should be free WITHOUT Western intervention or Israeli intervention because everytime the U.S. has done that we installed a tyrant or dictator more friendly to Western policy or imperialism.\n\n2.

Queers for Palestine aren’t Chickens for KFC come on. Outside of Tel Aviv, a lot of LGBTQ people actually think that treatment of them is sub-par and not good. Hamas doesn’t throw gay people off roofs, that was an ISIS execution and ISIS and Hamas are enemies as well as different groups.

A theocratic tyranny that reacts violently to the merest suggestion of civil rights (particularly for women and LGBTs), forces its people to live in poverty while diverting their nation's wealth for the upper class, and spews hateful rhetoric to justify warmongering and violence in other nations.\n\nWorth noting that you didn't even acknowledge the whole \"LITERALLY SET ELDERLY JEWS ON FIRE\" thing... but then again, I didn't expect any \"anti-zionists\" to care about that. But I would have thought you'd at least give a little lip service to Hamas and its torture-murder of gays and the trafficking of children, when jumping in to defend the Ayatollah's regime.",

I've never encountered any serious Christian Zionist teacher or book claiming that Jews need to gather in Israel so they can all die horribly while Christians get raptured to heaven, and honestly that's such a cartoonish misrepresentation that it makes me wonder where you even got this idea from because it sure wasn't from actually reading what these people believe. The actual theological framework most Christian Zionists work from comes straight out of the Tanakh (books like Zechariah and Ezekiel written by *your* prophets) which prophesy that in the last days Israel will be restored, attacked by nations, and then God will personally intervene to defend them and judge the world based on how they treated the Jewish people, and plenty of Christians also draw on their own scriptures which predict that *Christians* (not Jews) will face severe persecution before Christ returns, so if anything the shoe's on the other foot regarding who's supposedly dying horribly.\n\nYou're also confusing the rapture with the second coming which suggests you don't actually understand the eschatological framework you're critiquing, and not even all Christian Zionists believe in a pre-tribulation rapture anyway so you're attacking a position that isn't even universally held among the group you're criticizing. What's really going on here is that many Christians support Israel for the same reasons other Westerners do (shared democratic values, common threats, cultural affinity) and yes some *also* have theological reasons rooted in believing that God's covenantal promises to the Jewish people still stand, but reducing that to \"they want us all dead so they can go to heaven\" is exactly the kind of bad faith misrepresentation that anti-Zionists use to drive wedges between Israel and one of its most reliable support bases. You can disagree with Christian eschatology all you want but at least represent what people actually believe before you call them creepy, because right now you're essentially repeating talking points designed by people who want to isolate Israel by convincing Jews that their Christian allies are secretly hoping for their destruction, which is both factually wrong and strategically foolish.",

Other questions are generalizations based on fair arguments. I'm not sure what the analogy for \"Zionist is a slur\" - that Islam has bad rep? Let's try to answer your Q's:\n\n&gt;palestinians are squatters on jewish land\n\nSaid by those who believe the land is Jewish either because it used to be ruled by Jews (historical precedence) or the providence of God to the Jews (religious doctrine). The former is fallacy (right by might and the Jews lost), and the latter is stupid - unless you're religious, in which case you just believe whatever you want.\n\n&gt;palestinians are arabs from arabia, jordan, and egypt\n\nIt's an ignorant take - the Arab conquest Arabized the locals, it didn't replace them with Arabs. I think it doesn't matter because the Arabs that are in Palestine today are Palestinians enough, for all intents and purposes. But it wasn't always the case.\n\n&gt;palestinians are a fake people\n\nProbably rooted in the Palestinian nationality being a recent concept. The first *Palestinian* Arab congress took place in 1919. The local elites defined their \"Palestinian\" identity thusly:\n\n&gt; We consider Palestine nothing but part of Arab Syria, and it has never been separated from it at any stage. We are tied to it by national, religious, linguistic, moral, economic, and geographic bounds\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Syria\n\nIdentities evolve and so do national identities. It took decades past this point for the modern Palestinian identity to coalesce, and I believe it wouldn't have become distinguishable from Syrian or Pan-Arab identity had it not been for the Jews emerging as a local sovereignty, while the rest of the Arabs were defeated in claiming the land and its inhabitants for themselves.\n\nI'll remind you that, in the decades following Israel's creation, Egypt, Jordan and Syria invaded Palestine to claim it for themselves, not to \"free the Palestinians\".\n\n&gt;\"muslim behavior is the reason for islamophobia\"\n\nA generalization ignoring bigotry and racism. But let's look at some dry statistics:\n\n\\- All Arab states are dictatorships\n\n\\- Islam is the dominant religion in the world's most violent countries\n\n\\- Islam is the dominant religion in global terrorism\n\nCombine these 3 with Islam's expansionist doctrine and natural demographics, and you've got a good reason to fear Islam.\n\n&gt;\"why should palestinians get western treatment when they behave like animals\"\n\nThis is a bit of a generalization, and I don't know about \"animals\", but *collectively*, Palestinians do not adhere to Western values. The idea that Palestinians would somehow erect a western democracy, let alone sustain one, is complete fantasy and has no historical evidence to support it.",

You wont catch him saying \"the jews\" but he still is saying it. He will now say \"the zionists\" however. That did not stop him from being a trusted ally of israel and american zionists. The same went for Charlie Kirk before his death. Even Candace owens was an accepted antisemite on the jewish right before she took a turn against zionism although in her case she has since devolved into some middle ages level antisemitism.

So you see A LOT of the ugly side of Israel that like I mentioned earlier - exists in every country, but not a lot of the good side.\n\nFor example, many people would hear about \"settler violence\" or radical sentences some people say but barely any people will hear about co-existance organizations in Israel or the co-existance (people live side by side, work side by side &amp; you can see both groups in most public areas like trains, media or markets).\n\nSo while I do get why you focus on those things since that's what you're exposed to from the outside, this is more of a PR problem than a core issue unique to Israel.",

I'm not aware of Israel publishing its reasoning, but they do have a longstanding tradition of voting alongside the USA.\n\nHere is the USA's reason for voting \"no\" as described in the document: \n\n1. The draft did not offer meaningful, concrete steps to solving the problem.\n2. It did not give enough focus on famine often being primarily manmade, the result of conflict. The way to resolve those famines is by ending the conflicts.\n3. It inappropriately discussed trade, which had already been covered in other treaties.\n4. It contained some specific line items with which the USA disagreed. Specifically, on pesticides, on climate change, and on technology transfer.\n5. The responsibility for implementing human rights obligations is on the state, not on the international community.\n\nThey wrap it up with this (emphasis mine):\n\n&gt;**The United States supports the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living, including food**, as recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Domestically, the United States pursues policies that promote access to food, and it is our objective to achieve a world where everyone has adequate access to food, but **we do not treat the right to food as an enforceable obligation.**",

I’m not a pacifist. \n\nOn the other hand (and I’m writing here as a religious Zionist): The name Palestine has been around for a long time, and the living people who identify themselves as Palestinian, or as other types of non-Israeli people living in Israel and Palestine, are human beings created in the divine image of G-d, and are mostly our spiritual cousins through Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac. \n\nThey all have the same rights all people have. \n\nIf they haven’t done anything wrong, they have the same rights all innocent people have, even if they hate us.

In post-WW1 period, as Palestinians nationalism really started to gain support, most Arab residents of Palestine wanted to be part of a greater Syria, not an independent Palestine.

The concept of Indonesian was a project started by an anti-colonialist political party, Sarekat Islam, who in 1912, promoted the idea that 'Indonesian' was any person living under Dutch colonial rule in the Dutch East Indies (they were initially founded to oppose Chinese traders, but within a year pivoted to Indonesian nationalism). This arcepelego spanning concept of nationality, for a time, competed with the Island based independence movements, that promoted natavist, blood and land, concept of nationality. The more familiar inherited nationality. In the 1920-30s these natavist independence movements disbanded and merged with the arcepelego spanning nationality, both were united in their opposition to Dutch colonial rule. In 1945, shortly after Japanese occupation ended, Indonesian nationalists declared independence, resulting in a conflict between Indonesian nationalists, the Dutch colonial power (and allied countries) and well as an internal struggle, often against communists (a bit of a mess). Over 100,000 people were killed.",

In that case they mostly agree with the violent occupier.  There is nothing hypocritical about believing certain actions are justified by specific circumstances.  There are times when I think a left turn is the right move while driving, other times I don't. \n\nNow I will say that pro-Israelis do support democracy and at least in the west do support liberalization.  The Yishuv and the WZC were democracies.  The WZC is still a democracy.  When they founded the Knesset and thus the state they did it as a democracy.  Israel has a rich democratic heritage.  That's not a country you can accuse of being indifferent to democracy.  \n\nIsraelis did however run a military dictatorship in the Disputed Territories.  They tried repeatedly to found democracies in the territories.  The Village Leagues and the PA remained democracies for a time but both collapsed into dictatorships.  Israel is not the one preventing PA elections, nor for that matter is Hamas; Fatah has been the problem there.  I think Israelis are open to democracy but in their opinion the Palestinians are mostly indifferent to it.  \n\nAs far as Liberalization... Israel / Yishuv was a world leader on liberalizaton in many respects from the 1930s-90s.  Since then it has lagged.  But one doesn't become a world leader in an area with active hostility.  Israel's supporters have a phenomenal track record on liberalization in the West.  To pick an example Conservatives aren't wrong when they attribute a lot of development of feminism especially in the 1960s to Jewish Women with a shift to it mainly being a gentile movement in the 1970s.",

They have murdered over 71,000 civilians, and that number is clearly higher due to all the unrecovered bodies. 20,000 of those have been children. There is substantial evidence the IDF has targeted civilians.\n\nIsrael has thousands of Palestinians held in prisons without due process or a conviction. This was true before October 7.\n\nIsrael regularly evicts people from homes and ethnically cleanses villages, demolishes homes with an hour's notice before the residents' eyes, to make room for new settlements or for other unjustified purposes. This predated October 7 by a long time..\n\nIsraeli soldiers regularly raid Palestinian businesses and sabotage them, run over street vendors, and beat kids in the street. This was true before October 7 and is much worse today.\n\nIsraeli settler terrorists regularly invade Palestinian villages to terrorize the residents and beat them, under the protection of the IDF. This was true before October 7 and is much worse today.\n\nIsraeli terrorists and IDF soldiers often beat Palestinians to a pulp and then BLOCK THE AMBULANCES FROM REACHING THEM.\n\nIn the days of Israel's founding (1947-49), Israeli soldiers massacred entire villages, evicted Palestinians from homes and beat anyone who fought back, looted Palestinian homes, and regularly shot Palestinians for not complying, mirroring the actions of _________ (word deleted because of bot) in Europe.\n\nThis is why people think Israel is in the wrong.",

Didn't it consider them as inferior people who should only obey? Even today, Israeli-Palestinian citizens do not have the same rights as Jewish citizens.\n\nOne should admit that Israel wanted to rule and decide over Palestinians who should only obey. Palestinians protested of course, various agreements were made but they were not followed and so the situation for them became worse and worse. So Palestinians took up tougher resistance until it became what it became. Unfortunately. They did not expect it to become what it became. The original purpose of 7/10 was to show Israel that enough is enough and that the world wakes up and starts counting Palestinians among people.\n\nBut chaos ensued and so it became what it became, unfortunately.\n\nNo one was innocent, not Palestinians, but not Israelis either. I don't believe in such propaganda about children being burned, etc. Otherwise I'll start talking about how the IDF burned hundreds of people in Gaza, killed even their own, danced in front of destroyed schools, churches, how Palestinian prisoners are treated in prisons where they often ended up without a legal reason. Etc.\n\nIf I were Israel on 7/10 I would take a serious look at why it happened, would start thinking selflessly, about all people regardless of ethnic origin and actually admit that I could have acted a little differently, not harmed Palestinians as much as I did before. And certainly not killed as many as I did, not devastated all of Gaza either. And not murdered them after agreeing on a ceasefire, but I would follow in this case the 20 points the US has put forward.\n\nNote that I am an outsider and my ethnic origin is only European, not Arab or Jewish.",

    "body": "I appreciate you sharing your perspective as a European observer. It’s a complex situation, but to have a truly balanced conversation, there are several factual and legal points that need to be cleared up regarding the claims you’ve made.\n\nFirst, it is a common misconception that Arab-Israeli citizens (who make up about 21% of the population) have inferior legal status. Under Israeli law, they have full and equal rights: they vote in every election, hold seats in the Knesset (Parliament), and serve as judges on the Supreme Court. In fact, an Arab party was part of the governing coalition recently. While there are certainly socioeconomic disparities and historical tensions - much like minority populations face in Europe - it is inaccurate to say they lack the same rights as Jewish citizens.\n\nRegarding the idea that 10/7 was a protest that turned into ‘chaos’ or that atrocities were ‘propaganda’: multiple international bodies, including the UN and Human Rights Watch, have documented that the attacks involved systematic massacres, torture, sexual violence, and kidnapping. Captured documents and body-cam footage from the attackers themselves showed that the targeting of civilians was not an accident, but a pre-planned objective with specific maps of civilian communities.\n\nYou asked why the division didn’t happen.\nIt’s important to note that Israel has agreed to a two-state solution multiple times, as OP mentioned. Beyond the 1947 partition, Israel made significant offers in the Oslo Accords, Camp David Summits, and the 2008 Olmert Plan, which would have seen the creation of a Palestinian state on nearly all of the West Bank and Gaza. These offers were rejected by Palestinian leadership.\n\nRegarding the US 20-point plan you mentioned- that framework actually requires the complete demilitarization of Gaza and the removal of Hamas from power to ensure safety for both sides. It would require both leaderships to protect their civilians, something Hamas failed to do by using civilian infrastructure for military purposes.\n\nFinally, I’m not sure if you realize that Israel is a self-critical democracy. There is a robust Israeli Left and a massive network of peace activists who continuously advocate for a two-state solution and Palestinian rights. Even in the middle of a war, Israelis protest their own government and hold leaders accountable. This internal democratic pressure is exactly what allows for the possibility of change.",

    "body": "You have quite a one-sided view of the conflict and seem to have accepted only the zionist framing.\n\n&gt;Correct my statements if they are wrong as I am still learning about the war. From what I know, Britain promised the region to the Jews and the Arabs at the same time, of course this will start a war\n\nKinda? Britain committed itself to establish a Jewish national home in Palestine in 1917 with the Balfour Declaration. They also separately promised to support an independent Arab state in exchange for Arab support in defeating the Ottoman Empire. You could say that they are incompatible commitments, and in a way they are, but the important part is the actions that followed. \n\nAfter 1917 Britain worked with the zionist settlers to create quasi-state infrastructure in Palestine for the zionists and brutally suppressed the Palestinian opposition. So you can say they followed through on their commitment made in the Balfour Declaration. On the other hand, they did not follow through on their commitment to an independent Arab state. They secretly agreed with France how the region should be split between them in the Sykes Picot agreement. \n\n&gt;How would that be Israel’s fault for coming back to their ancestral homeland when the owner of the land tells you that you can have it?\n\nWell first because Britain wasn't the 'owner of the land', it was a colonial power. And more importantly because there were already people living there. Settlers coming to a place and demanding the natives leave so they can establish a state is still wrong whether or not the settlers view it as their ancestral homeland.   \n\n\n&gt;Despite this Israel tries to have a 2 state solution 4 different times. Palestine denies it every time and starts wars with Israel. Israel wins every time and Palestine loses land because of it. Again I ask, how does that make Israel the bad guy?\n\nI'm not sure what the 4 times you are referring to, but this is at best a very one sided way of presenting the history. After 1948, you have 750,000 Palestinians who have been ethnically cleansed from their homes who are now stateless. Since then, Israel has prevented them from returning to their homes, and at the same time blocked any moves towards an independent, sovereign and viable Palestinian state. In 1967, Israel invaded and occupied more territory, including the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the latter of which is the centre of Palestinian economic, religious and cultural life. It also fragmented the West Bank into separate areas cut off from each other and surrounded by new Israeli settlements, and cuts off Gaza from the rest of Palestine and the rest of the world more generally. \n\nSo the primary opposition to Israel these days tends to focus on the genocide in Gaza (obviously), and the occupation and oppression of Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. \n\n&gt;In 2005 they give Palestine gaza and what happens? Hamas uses it to build miles of tunnels and send hundreds or thousands of missiles to Israel. \n\nThis is a common misconception. Israel withdrew its settlers and soldiers from Gaza in 2005, but it didn't \"give Palestine Gaza\". It was still in effective control, so was still the occupying power according to international law and the leading international bodies. The leading expert on the political economy of Gaza is Sara Roy of Harvard, and her work showing how Israel deliberately 'de-developed' Gaza's economy during this period is required reading on this topic. \n\n&gt;What would you have done if you were Israel?\n\nThe obvious answer is \"not commit a genocide\", but I will expand on that a little. The key point is to understand the underlying cause and work to address it. Palestinian resistance has come in many forms, but at its heart its a fight against an occupying power who has expelled them from their homeland and rendered them a stateless people at the mercy of Israeli occupation and aggression. The solution is to take the difficult steps necessary to end the occupation and work towards living in peace. End the siege on Gaza and the illegal settlement expansion in the West Bank, and give equal rights and freedoms to Palestinians as Israeli Jews currently enjoy. It's a difficult process and it wouldn't solve everything overnight. But the current playbook is also untenable. It just reproduces a cycle of violence that will end with the extermination or expulsion of one group of people. We desperately need a new approach and new ideas, and that will take bravery and real leaders, not just politicians.",

By fighting for protections, laws and human rights. My own preferred resolution would be a single binational secular state where every inhabitant had equality under the law regardless of their race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, etc. You could have a specific legislature with representatives from each ethnicity, with any bill that affects a minority requiring a certain level of support from that minority's representatives, a constitution with human rights that requires a supermajority to change, a special legislative function for Jerusalem, etc.  There's a lot of creative ideas of how to achieve it - you look at other examples that have worked, learn from their mistakes, see what unique features Israel and Palestine would have, and fight to make it a reality.\n\n&gt;At the end of the day, Palestinians in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza are not citizens of Israel.

The Palestinians were never Egyptian,  even when Egypt occupied Gaza. Arabs aren't a monolith. Also, your description of the Nakba and subsequent wars leaves quite a lot to be desired.  Fundamentally, there's a group of people who are stateless and living under occupation, and that needs to end. You can disagree on whether it should end by way of a one state or a two state solution (though I think at this point, the notion of a viable two state solution is dead and buried), but you can't just pretend that Palestinians will suddenly become Jordanians or Egyptians and give up any claim to their homes.",

That's the UN and the surrounding Arab states position, but certainly not mine. \n\nI'd point out that the majority of them are recent Arabized immigrants and as such they don't have any significant ties to the land.

A building built by the Jewish King Herod over the Tombs of the Abraham, Issac, Sarah, Rivkah and Jacob who became Israel. Later turned into a Mosque by the invading Arab armies. \n\nJews were only be allowed to go up to the 7th step as a sign of humiliation and inferiority to the Muslims.. Any Jew that passed the 7th step would be beaten and some even killed. This wasn't in the far past, this was happening until 1967. Only when the Jews defeated the Arabs, for the 1st time in 700 years they could walk past the 7th step.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cEDTMV8X8\n\n.\n\nJews were barred access to the temple mount, the holiest place in Judiasm.. not 3rd or 4th.. The holiest place to Jews thousands of years before Islam was even a thought.. since they could not gain access they prayed at the eastern wall instead.. \n\nArabs/Muslims didn't like the Jews praying there, so they placed a muslim cemetery at the eastern wall, both to stop Jews from praying there and prevent the return of the Jewish messiah who was supposed to enter the city from that side, they even blocked the gate. \n\nIt was only in the 1500's when an earthquake knocked a few buildings over near the western wall the ottomans allowed Jews a small section, about 30 feet wide to pray in, and that didn't last that long either with the Muslim community constantly attacking and killing Jews for praying there..\n\nJews would have to go and pray at time when no-one was there, since Arabs mobs would randomly beat Jews they found there.\n\n. \n\nAl-Qawuqji family.. in particular Fawzi. Fawzi served as a Colonel in the Nazi military. Later escaping to the mandate of Palestine at the end of the war.. His most famed quote \"*The battle between the Arabs and the Jews is a total battle, and the only possibility is the annihilation of every Jew in Palestine and all Arab countries*\".\n\nLater as leader of the ALA during the 1947-48 war, he decided to put his many calls to murder all Jews into actions, and was responsible for what would later be called acts of Genocide. His men had blocked all routes in and out of the Jewish sections of Jerusalem, proceeded to firebomb all food stores in the Jewish area, making sure no food can reach the 140,000+ Jewish civilians/inhabitants. \n\nHe then later ordered Cpt. Madlul Abbas to destroy the only spring/water supply to the Jewish quarter, leaving all the civilians without water or food. He also refused to allow Red Cross access to the blockaded Jewish quarter.  He then also setup snipers to shoot and kill any Jews that they saw walking the streets\n\nAs starvation set in, complaints from the Red cross and UN started to mount as well intentional pressure, eventually forcing King Abdullah to make a truce where international officials and the red cross could access Jerusalem. This was mainly triggeed after images and news of the conditions of the Jews in Jerusalem in the 7 month siege made their way to to international media. After this and several more atrocities made their way to international news, King Abdullah disbanded the ALA.\n\nThe end result of the war was the complete ethnic cleansing of over 140,000 Jews from Jerusalem, Hebron and other west bank towns, that with the previous ethnic cleansing of Jews from Gaza in the 1920's during the Arab riots made the Arabs 100% successful at ethnic cleansing all Jews from territories that they held at the end of the 48 war.\n\n.\n\nThe aftermath.. There were about 35 synagogue inside the walls of Jerusalem, most of them were built underground, because no Jewish synagogue was allowed to be above a Mosque. Eventually the ottomans allowed the Jews to build above the ground, so several larger and above ground ones were built in the mid 1800's.. then after the 48 war..\n\nhttps://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jordan-s-desecration-of-jerualem-1948-1967\n\n*All but one of the 35 synagogues within the Old City were destroyed; those not completely devastated had been used as hen houses and stables filled with dung-heaps, garbage. and carcasses. The revered Jewish graveyard on the Mount of Olives was in complete disarray with thousands of tombstones broken, some of which were used as building materials for roads and latrines. Large areas of the cemetery were leveled to provide a short-cut to a new hotel. Hundreds of Torah scrolls and thousands of holy books were plundered and burned to ashes*\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_of_Olives\n\n*some Arab residents uprooted tombstones and plowed the land in the cemeteries, and an estimated 38,000 tombstones were damaged in total. During this period, a road was paved through the cemetery, in the process destroying graves including those of famous persons. In 1964, the Intercontinental Hotel was built at the summit of the mount. Graves were also demolished for parking lots and a filling station and were used in latrines at a Jordanian Army barracks*\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Jewish_cemetery,_Hebron\n\n*During the Jordanian period (1948–1967), the cemetery was intentionally destroyed and the site was cultivated by Arab residents for growing produce. Around 4,000 tombstones were removed and used for construction purposes*\n\n\n.\n\nDirect quotes from Fawzi al-Qawuqji Memoirs..\n\n\"*These reports also indicated that the fires caused by our bombardment of Jewish installations had burnt down many of their provision stores, that the Jews were in utter despair*\"\n\n\"*the Jewish areas depended entirely on water from the Ras al-Ain position, while the Arabs could use the wells in the old city. I therefore cabled to Captain Madlul Abbas, the Commander of the Hattin Battalion, telling him without delay to cut off the water at the springs, which were in his area.*\"",

Including the most heinous of violations of international law (hostage taking of toddlers, Extermination, Genocide), or their proud, longstanding, primary strategy of either openly indiscriminate attacks, or outright targeting Israeli Jewish civilians, without any attempt to pretend to be targeting lawful targets. Or their a systematic, more or less universal abuse of international law for cover for their illegal military activities (Perfidy, Human Shields), that are the direct, intentional reason for the heavy death toll and destruction on *their own* side. And from an ad bellum perspective, the completely illegal, openly stated goal of conquering the state of Israel and annexing it to Palestine, followed by stripping the Israeli Jews of their inalienable right of self determination at best, and complete destruction of the Israeli Jews at worst.\n\nUnlike Israel, Hamas/PIJ don't even pretend to follow the LOAC or IHL, have no equivalent of the Israeli MAG, military courts, or the IAF legal advisors for every strike, any judicial review of international law violations by Gazan courts (which, to be clear, did exist), or anything else that would even remotely seem like a desire to comply with international law. And if anything, the Hamas government loudly praise and reward the most criminal of behaviors by their members, if they don't simply order it outright, while making slick propaganda videos boasting about their systematic, unquestionable criminality.\n\nFinally, as OP correctly pointed out, the fact any Gazan civilians were killed at all in this particular conflict, and any Gazan homes were destroyed, is a direct result of criminal choices made by Hamas, and forced on the Israelis against their will. The choice to start this war of aggression to begin with, by invading Israel and committing Genocide (or at the very least Extermination, hostage taking, gang-rape-executions etc.) in peaceful Israeli Jewish communities. The choice to illegally place their entire war machine under and inside people's homes, schools, hospitals, mosques and other civilian objects, and while refusing to wear any distinguishing marks while fighting (as opposed to revolting parades of hostages, for example), and generally building their entire defensive strategy on abusing international law and maximizing their own civilian casualties. Finally, they made the choice to not end the war for two years, by refusing to comply with their legal requirement to immediately and unconditionally release all of their hostages, and stand trial of their crimes - or even accept the generous pardon and exile that the Israelis offered them.\n\nAnd of course, the far more nuanced violations of international law by Israel, simply cannot absolve Hamas of their legal responsibilities, both to Israelis and their own population.\n\nThe fact is, from the perspective of international law, this is still very much a \"both sides\" issue - with the Palestinian side being significantly worse, on every imaginable level. OP talked about a \"middle road\", and your attempt to swerve hard into the \"but Israel is bad\" side, is simply not justifiable.",

With essentially no attempt whatsoever to follow international law, nothing that comes even close to the Israeli attempts to do so (however deficient you mind find them). And if anything, the Palestinians have a longstanding strategic policy to completely flaunt any obligations they might have under IHL (and international law period), only taking note of IHL when they intentionally abuse it, and this policy forms the core of their military strategy.  And when talking about the recent Gaza conflict, the Palestinian criminal choices are the main driving force behind the suffering and death inflicted on both Gazans and Israelis. So again, trying to take OP's argument about the \"middle road\", and swerving hard into \"Israel is evil\", *especially* if you justify it with \"no middle road when it comes to legal obligations\", is just not justifiable or \"serious\", on any level.\n\nAs for the second paragraph, what's fundamentally \"unserious\" is your engagement with my argument, or rather, refusal to engage with it. If Hamas didn't start this illegal war of aggression, and didn't illegally enmesh themselves within their civilian population, considerations like the proportionality of strikes on civilian objects wouldn't even come into play. Once the Palestinians did make that set of intentional, fundamental criminal choices, it's not impossible, but certainly much, much harder for Israel to pursue their legitimate war aims legally. And it's basically impossible for them to do so, without people like you simply declaring any attack that \"foreseeably killed civilians\" is automatically disproportional, a war crime, and possibly even equivalent to the widespread and systematic Palestinian practice of intentionally targeting civilians, based on the little skewed information they get from the media.\n\nThat's not a coincidence. That's literally the point. The reason why Hamas invested so much effort and money into their criminal strategy of human shielding and perfidy.  You don't get to ignore that, and wave it off with \"who cares, let's talk about Israeli legal obligations instead\".",

That is up to them but given their history we can aspire to a constitutional monarchy at best.

They need to change so much, instead of blaming pretty much everyone but themselves for the mess they found themselves in they could succeed into turning that mess into a livable situation for them and their families if they choose to bond together over anything else than hatred itself.\n\nThey lost over 10 wars in this almost 80 years conflict, and things are looking dire to them.

But let me go down to the premise here that you haven’t seen much. Firstly, the claim that we cared SOLEY because we are adverse to violence is a fringe claim. We aren’t inherently humanists. Some people here are, but this is the exception not a rule. Now, I care about this issue, but it just hasn’t come up nearly as much on my feeds. Had it not been for Warfronts the YouTube channel and this subreddit as well as a small mention on the Lebanese news networks, I wouldn’t have known about this. Additionally what is the requirement here? “You, the people who are averse to violence, why are you not watching and commenting on mass violence every time it comes up? You should be on the lookout for all the violence you don’t want to see.”\n\nBut OK I’ll play the little game this time\n\nThe Iranian regime’s reaction to the protests has illegidtimzed the government entirely. This corrupt institution has done so much harm to the people in self interest that their forceful removal of power is philosophically valid. No government should treat those it tyrannizes the way the Iranian government is doing so. Condemnation is worthy for a government to kill as many as 2500 people against the government wishes and any government who kills as many as 2500 innocents has a lot to answer for. \n\nOK, have I paid the speech tax sufficiently so that I get to actually talk about the Israel’s insistent abuse of the Palestinians, or do I have to do more performative exercises in order to meet the arbitrary quota of outrage expenditure that is demanded of me by you?",

If the country ignored Israel and didn’t actively utilize armed groups dedicated to violence against it, then Israel would largely ignore it. Algeria, a Muslim country that does not recognize Israel, doesn’t occupy a major part of the average Israeli’s mind as its foreign policy does not revolve around opposition to it. There is nothing irrational about Israel’s view here and it goes beyond the personal whims of Netanyahu.\n\nRegarding Iran, our dispute with them originates independently of Israel. One of the Islamic Republic’s first acts was to keep Americans hostage for well over a year. Again, this had nothing to do with Israel. Only a few years later their proxies murdered over 200 marines. The American conflict with Iran is incredibly complex and Iran’s opposition to Israel is but one factor. On a more personal level, Trump himself grew up in a time when Iran was a major ally of the United States and he looks at the revolution as an embarrassing example of American failure. He wants to be the one to do what a democratic administration (Carter) couldn’t. \n\nIt seems you are opposed to the reality that America is an empire and we intervene in everyone’s politics. In theory, I can sympathize with the isolationist’s fantasy of us transforming into some sort of Switzerland of the Americas but a surrender of American world dominance would certainly come with consequences that many Americans would not like. For all the complaining of the billions we spent on foreign affairs, our massive GDP (number one in the world), and our dollar being the world economy’s reserve currency, is a direct result of our dominance (economically and militarily) on the world stage. It’s worth remembering that only a few short years before we established global dominance as a result of WWII, our economy was garbage. Retreating from the world stage now would not magically let us keep the benefits of hegemony without any of the negatives.",

So if someone criticizes Israel or wishes to distance from Israel a bit more, they support Iran. This is an absolutely absurd position. Is it possible that someone could be against Iran's protests and Israels policies towards Palestine? \n\n\n&gt; If the Ayatollah falls, it strengthens the strategic position of the United States and Israel. \n\n\nWe don't actually know what will happen. Surely the fall of Gaddafi and the fall of Saddam Hussein strengthened the strategic position of the US and Israel.... Except it never did. So far what we have is the former Shahs son as an alternative. The end of Hussein's and Gaddafi's governments was handled so poorly people miss them. \n\n\nThe protestors are united against the Iranian government, but I don't see how that shows that they're pro US and pro Israel. \n\n\n&gt; Figures like Mamdani argue that the modern states - particularly the United States and Israel-are a colonial construct that must be \"deconstructed.\" \n\n\nThis is the second time you referenced Mamdami and this time you provide an imaginary quote. You do realize that Mamdami is the Mayor of NYC right? \n\n\n&gt; it is similar to how they barely supported the overthrow of Maduro, and were mainly busy attacking Trump. \n\n\nI don't know why you bring this up because it is the opposite of what's going on in Iran. Maduros government is still in place, nothing actually changed there. Trumps only priority is having a leader he can pressure to be an American vassal and to pump out oil. It is blatantly imperialistic and has nothing to do with \"humanity\". \n\n\nOverall you have the classic Twitter Goomba argument. \" people who hold Opinion A and Opinion B are hypocrites\", when there are people who hold one or the other, and you lump them in together. This whole post is arguing against an imaginary caricature. No one is quoted, and huge leaps in logic are made. ",

Your snark about \"evil communist Muslim Antifa super soldiers\" misses the point entirely because nobody's claiming some grand unified conspiracy *but rather noticing that disparate groups keep making common cause against liberal democracies even though their endgames are completely incompatible,* and if pointing out that pattern makes you uncomfortable enough to call it triumphalist wibble then maybe you should ask yourself why you're so bothered that someone noticed what side you've chosen and what company you're keeping.",

He claims that not only is it antisemitic to say Jews are less than any other group, it’s also antisemitic to say that they are equal! Jews must be seen as superior to the rest of us, otherwise it’s antisemitic. \n\nSo with that logic, you can see treating Israel like a normal country that needs to follow the same rules as other countries would also be antisemitic. \n\nAnd all of that of course assumes you agree that Israel is Jewish. Jewish people and Israel are synonymous. Just statistically, like 80% of Jews support Israel and over 70% of Israelis are Jewish. So….criticizing one is criticizing the other.",

Ok, I mean I can meet you half-way on this but it’s a bit exhausting…  \n\nThis is really confusing. So if I turn on the TV, and I see a radical settler shooting a Palestinian farmer. If I have the perspective that the Israeli govt. is not swiftly moving to hold that person accountable, it would be a criticism of the govt. Is anti-Semitic to discuss this in a vacuum without discussing the way PLO or Hamas for instance treats Palestinians? Or, equally discuss the last terror action Palestinians took against Israel? \n\nIt’s not just this post. It’s across Reddit. If there is a criticism of Israeli policy, the comments are super defensive and cast the person asking the question reflexively a being bias. Why the the topic shift away from the question/point to a discussion of bias? I don’t have this problem with other discussion topics. I’m bias towards with a criminal history when hire people. I’m still expecting an answer for a question. I hope I’m not bias against Israel, but I accept that I may be. I’m open to that.  \n\nThis is really a struggle for me. I have zero hate against Jews. You have a god given right to have the exact same rights and privileges as any other group of people, or individuals more broadly. My best friend is Jewish. I have dated Jewish women. Saying you are Jewish or Israeli does not incite any anger or discomfort for me. \n\nI’m struggling….

Liberal Israelis don’t hate the Palestinian people, but they certainly don’t trust them either, they kind of ignore them and get on with their lives (I’m not saying that’s right, but thats how it feels in Tel Aviv, less so in Jerusalem). \nIn short, criticism of the conduct of the Israeli government is clearly not antisemitic, I’m a Zionist Jew and I abhor the current government.  Being opposed to Zionism isn’t antisemitism either (many of my fellow Jews will disagree with this).  However the use of the word Zionism these days is usually an antisemitic dog whistle, and ‘Zio’ feels straight up antisemitic every time I see it (and on Reddit I see it absolutely everywhere) .  As someone else has pointed out, criticism of Israel veers straight into antisemitism with depressing frequency when people demonise all Israeli people rather than the actions of their government.\n\n  If that doesn’t land for you consider this - would you think it was racist if people abroad were harassing Chinese people, refusing to serve them in restaurants and hotels etc, due to the mistreatment of Uyghurs, or Americans cause of Trump’s bullsh*t etc.?

People on this forum are saying that the lack of criticism of Iran compared to Israel proves antisemitism, ignoring the fact that Iran is already an international pariah and more sanctions are being added as we speak while international governments are openly siding with their resistance, while protestors ask for a fraction of this to be done to Israel to no avail. \n\nOn the other hand, you do have people (like one I just bumped into on another subreddit) who are convinced that Israel faked the Bondi beach attack against itself.

Any supposed “liberal” should be rightly horrified by this brutal, repressive and hateful regime, but because so many people simply have a rabid hate for Israel, they can’t bring themselves to denounce the most obvious human rights abusers on earth. So it simply proves the “pro Palestine” crowd, it’s not really about human rights or dignity for Palestinians, it’s simply about demonization and hatred of Israel.

    "body": "&gt;First off “the river to the sea” is originally an Israeli quote.\n\nActually it comes from Arabic and it is still today called out in Arabic. In English it would be \"from the water to the water Palestine will be Arab\" or some variation of that.  But Western ears wouldn't like that so they use \"free\".\n\nFree of what exactly? Considering that in Israel everyone, including all Arabs are already free, then it can't mean free democratically or rights. The area of Israel is included in \"river to sea\", so it isn't freedom in the territories.\n\nThat means that the only meaning by the marchers of \"the river to the sea Palestine will be free\" means free from Israel in the area where Israel exists. Which is another way of calling for Israel dismantling. Which, like I mentioned, is explicitly said by the protesters. . \n\n&gt; meant by Israelis to claim ALL the land for only Israeli Jews\n\nYou see, here see how you've been manipulated. The land was never claimed by Israel \"only for Israeli Jews\". Even the Likud charter from 1977 says Israel sovereignty and explicitly gives the reason that a Palestinian state would be a huge security to Israel. Nowhere does it mentions only Jewish.\n\nIn fact, where the river to the sea be under Israel sovereignty then everyone will be free just as they are in Israel. Jews, Christians, Arab etc. all have equal rights in Israel which has been forced by the courts multiple times when minorities' rights were broken. \n\nWhy did I bring that up? Because it proves you are wrong. If \"The United States support, funding and arming of Israel is absolutely the driving factor behind anti Israeli sentiments in the US\" then the only cry of the protesters would be \"stop funding\". The top cry, shouted repeatedly should be \"Stop funding Israel\". \n\nBut that wasn't true. You didn't hear that cry. You only heard it when they are forced to justify anti-israel protests where there are no protest for \"anti-syria\", or \"anti-RSF\", ect. An argument you're repeating now.\n\nSide note:\nIt also showed how they pulled in the ignorant masses, telling them \"you, the taxpayer, is not getting benefits because all your money is going to Israel\". Which in an economic sense is a lie, as US aid to Israel is negligible in US budget. But it works, as it gives people a target to blame their financial problems on. But did the leaders of the protests make the ignorant shout \"stop giving aid to Israel \"? No. They made then shout\"Palestine will be free\" - which has nothing to do with US economy. So again, the economic hardship is just a means too get people involved, but wasn't a goal of the protests.\n\n\n&gt;I’m not European so I can’t speak for them.\n\nBut you can see how they behaved the same as in the US even when Europe didn't aid Israel. If you ask them they use the excuse it's because Europe sells arms to Israel. What about Australia? They don't even sell arms to Israel and they're were huge anti-israel protests. \n\nIf you believe the underlying reason for the protests is the support of Israel - then you're either ignorant or you're lying to yourself. It's about Israel, and only Israel. Why? maybe you should ask yourself that question.",

    "body": "I kinda agree with most of what you've said. Like im a bit sympathetic to modern displacement but overall I'd rather have jewish nationalism be in charge than Islamic nationalism. I am critical of religious nationalism but I think Islam tends to be more regressive with fewer rights than jewish or Christian nationalism. Lesser of 3 evils. Plus Judaism is older than Christianity and Islam so it kinda makes sense to me that they have an older claim and I do view arab expansion as a type of colonization. The muslims opress more groups than the other 2. I think if Islam wasnt so regressive towards progress I'd be more sympathetic but mostly I don't want them to have authority or be in charge of others. Ppl who legislate religious rules into law make me cautious/suspicious of where it will lead and I do think they want the whole world to be Muslim. If they could force us to live their lifestyle they would. Jews on other hand don't convert ppl. Israeli gov is also mostly secular. The main thing I disagree with israel on would be continually  expanding territory more recently. Like i agree they should have a homeland around Judea which is their origin point but Israel keeps expanding which I disagree with. I do think some jews opress Muslims but Muslims opress most ppl. Their laws remind me of midevil Christian laws. I'd prefer if all countries  were more secular. Islamic conservatives make Christian conservatives look tame in comparison. So I dislike Arab Muslim nationalism the same as white Christian nationalism.    That being said I dislike their leadership moreso than the average person so im sympathetic towards the citizens but don't trust their choices in leadership as in Muslim nations they keep electing extremists. There's too many negative things in the Muslim world for me to trust em to be in charge of stuff. Sex morality laws, slavery, and honor killings running rampant plus the whole wanting to convert the world even if by force make me suspicious. At least the christians stopped forced conversion. A Christian may shun u for leaving religion but wouldnt do an honor killing. Many christians worship in secret in Muslim nations. Heck even some branches of Islam keep their worship secret so other Muslims won't kill em. So on one hand I don't want their citizens to be mistreated but on other hand I don't want them in charge of anything and if we can stop them from having authority that could be a good thing. I can kinda see both sides on this. When they have self governance they opress more types of ppl than jewish nationalism does. They pretty much do what an extreme white  Christian nationalists wishes they could do if they could get away with it. I think any religious book can be used to justify atrocities like how christians justified slavery with Bible. But that was more of a thing for christians in past. Still happens but Less common today. Wheras aggressive interpretations of quoran r on the rise. Why they keep appointing extremists idk maybe the more u suffer the more strength/ruthlessness u want in leadership? Idk the why. But ive nvr heard of a progressive Muslim leader in a Muslim nation. I see it as more dangerous for more ppl to be under Islamic rule than jewish rule. Srry if this was too long.",

I agree it should exist but don't like their methods. A two state solution would be better than either side fully winning. But I don't like theocratic or placing religious stuff in government and Israel's government is secular so im always bit biased against any religion being enshrined in government. I think any religion can be interpreted for good or evil so the religion itself can go either way but when religion is enshrined in government it can go bad quickly. Government corrupts religion when mixed. And outta the dozen of countries with Islamic law enshrined most r oppressive. So im not hopeful a new Islamic state will go well. If the Palestinians wanted a secular government and/or a more progressive government I may change my stances. In Islamic states they opress anyone who isn't a straight male Muslim, they opress a wider variety of ppl. The list of ppl isreal mistreated is shorter. So im not saying isreal is great and glorious or anything like that. Just lesser of 2 oppressive systems. Plus I think when I was younger after learning about holocaust when I heard of isreal I was happy they had there own home now. As a place to retreat to. If the muslims wanna retreat they have dozens of option while jews only have 1 option. But I don't like that isreal keeps expanding so im not fully on board I just like idea of them having a place to retreat to in case another holocaust happens to em again. I challenge my views by watching videos on both sides. Though another bias I have is islam is a conversion based religion and many muslims say one day everyone will be Muslim. I've seen videos of muslims saying \" we arnt here to integrate we are here to conquer/take over\" and its hard to hear that stuff and not take it as a threat. Jews conversely don't recruit ppl. They only have 7 rules for non jews wheras muslims r more likely to impose their rules on non followers. So I don't view Judaism as something that spreads. The spread of Christianity did harm and im critical of christians who r pushy about conversion. Any religion that wants to convert the whole world is a threat to every culture that's not them. I have less of an issue with religions that don't convert. Closed practice religions only raise their own kids as religious so its less imposing. So its not just that they treat more ppl badly and their own ppl badly its also that I think they wanna spread said mistreatment on a global lv. Though ive nvr had issues with the muslims ive met irl. Its their leadership/governments/pw structures that i dislike. If there were any progressive muslim states without theocracy I'd change my tune.",

    "body": "&gt; Jews are from Israel. Most of us were displaced from there and scattered around the world, where we were constantly massacred and displaced, over and over. Due to these constant displacements, we started returning to our homeland after the 1400s (Spanish Inquisition), and the return kept amping up, especially in the 1800s (Russian pogroms) and early 1900s (Holocaust.)\n\n\nYou're lumping the pre Zionist immigration in with the Aaliyehs. Anyone discussing Zionism differentiates these movements of Jews to Palestine prior to the 1890's as distinct from the Aaliyehs. These Jews arrived in Palestine for religious reasons, they did not seek to usurp local authorities and found their own state, they just wanted to be in the land of their ancestors. They weren't thinking about re-establishing the state of Israel. \n\n\nIn other words the earlier migrants sought to integrate with the existing country, just as migrants to the US or Britain would. The Zionist migrants wanted to dispossess them of the land entirely and that's what inflamed tensions. \n\n\n&gt; During our exiles, Arab Muslim conquered the entire Middle East and Northern Africa. Then Ottoman Turks conquered the area, and then later Britain beat the Ottomans and took over. By the early 1900s, the land was mostly Arab thanks to those earlier Arab conquests — they were a mix of Arabs who had lived there for a long time, and Arabs who had just moved there to work for the British. Similarly, we were a mix of Jews who had been there for a long time, and Jews who had recently arrived. Ottomans/British were the ones actually ruling things though.\n\n\nThe vast majority of Arabs had lived there for millennia, the vast majority of Jews were recent arrivals. Not merely recent arrivals but ideological ones too; they came with the dream of taking the land for themselves and establishing a Jewish state. They bought up land, using funds they raised abroad, and then evicted the Arabs living on them. When they owned the land they prioritized their own; they hired only Jews as farm laborers and tried to create their own separate society. The British in the 1920's were firmly on the side of the Zionists and supported their settlements despite knowing how much if a problem it was causing there. Eventually this led to a revolt and unrest in Palestine forcing them to stop Zionist immigration to Palestine. \n\n\nImagine if some from the UAE began buying up Israeli land and only allowed Arabs to live on it? I'm certain Israeli society would be fine with that. \n\n\n&gt; Obviously, the Jewish desire to have 0.1% of the Middle East interfered with the Arab plans to conquer 100% of it.\n\n\nThat is such a biased way of looking at it. The Arabs weren't \"conquering\" anything; they were already there! It was the Zionists who were conquering land away and dictating what would happen. They erased countless Palestinian villages and towns, they reshaped the land so they couldn't come back after being expelled, they killed or expelled the Arabs off of it to justify annexation. If one side has to rename everything and plant colonists it is fairly clear who's conquering who. \n\n\nAlso the same thing with lumping in Palestinians with all other Arabs! Palestinians are not Egyptians nor are they Jordanian. They're not interchangeable; it is far easier for an Israeli to become Moroccan, American, German, British etc. than it is for a Palestinian to become Lebanese or Egyptian. \n\n\n&gt; So Arabs started massacring Jews in the 1920s to prevent them having control anywhere, and Jews started fighting back in the 1930s, and you end up with ongoing tribal/militant fighting. The British got fed up with the fighting and left. \n\n\nAgain with this framing of lumping in Palestinians with every other Arab country. This is why people aren't taking it seriously. \n\n\nSo Arabs started massacring Jews in the 20's and the Jews fought back. Did the Jews massacre any Arabs? Did they commit any wrong against the Arabs? What about British colonial authorities? \n\n\n&gt; The UN tried to suggest that Jews have about .1% of the Middle East while the Arabs could have 99.9% of it. Jews agreed. Arabs refused and launched a war.\n\n\nThe UN constructed a solution that gave Jews as much land as possible while retaining a bare minimum 51% majority while the Palestinian state was 99% Arab. The Jewish state even got the Negev which gave them access to the Red Sea. \n\n\nNow there were two wars, the first with Israelis vs Palestinians and then Israel vs the coalition of Arab states. The first war started before there was even the UN resolution and it arose from escalating tit for tat attacks between Jews and Palestinians. The actual instigator is debatable. \n\n\nThe second was a bit different, Israel wasn't going to encompass the entire mandate and so there was going to be a power vacuum in the rest. That was one concern for the Arab states, of course they also hoped they could destroy the nascent Israeli state as well. \n\n\n&gt; Israel basically reacts to these attacks.\n\n\nIsrael wasn't reacting to any attack during the Suez Crisis or during the '67 War or even when they invaded Lebanon in 1982. They weren't reacting to any attack when they recently took more Syrian territory in the Golan Heights. \n\n\nWhat you don't mention is the mass colonization of the West Bank, where Israel continues to displace Palestinians from their land and plant settlements in their place. What you don't mention is the ethnic cleansing Israeli leaders admitted they took out. \n\n\nAnother thing you didn't mention was how Israeli society is dominated by Ashkenazim Jews. While they bring up taking Jews from all over the world, like Mizrahi or Sephardic, Ashkenazim Jews are the wealthiest and most powerful. Arab Jews in particular were discriminated against in Israel. Every single Israeli PM has been Ashkenazim, and their ancestry traces back to a relatively small geographic area in Eastern Europe, largely Poland, the Baltics, Belarus and Ukraine. It also ties into how Israelis portray themselves; as a bastion of Western civilization against a region of backwards antidemocratic autocrats. You can claim Jewishness all you want, but the European origin of the state is plain to see. \n\n\n ",

As concubines in a harem or as sex servant chambermaids from a slave market.\n\nOh but yes sure sure, do go on about your whole idea that tenants have an inalienable right not have the lease in their contract with a landlord who quite literally owns the property they’re staying in as well as the land it sits on, expire or not be renewed.\n\nAnd I love this interesting concept about how British Mandate Jews of the 1920s and 30s, somehow were in the wrong, after having seen their Muslim neighbors help kill or enslave 3.4 million Christian people just weeks or even days earlier if not still concurrently (the Genocide of Ottoman Christians by Muslims didn’t stop until 1924 and after, with Christian slaves still being sold into 1933), for wanting to hire only Jews which, let’s be honest, as much as you’d hate to admit and love to ignore, were famously not in the business of enslaving people while conquering Syria, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Yemen, Saudia, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt and the Sinai, the Sudan, while the Arabs were doing precisely this. And in time would repeat the trend across Somalia and Somaliland, Chad, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania, Western Sahara, from the British, Italians, French, Spanish.\n\nOkay so, a little more educated now buddy? Can you please now going forward, put into context the events of the British conquest of ottoman southern Syria and the British mandate, with the Muslims’ destruction 20% of people in the Middle East in the form of the extermination of the bulk of their Christians (outside of the Egyptian Copts or the Greek Cypriots of Cyprus) ?\n\nI hope that you can remember your own words that you so righteously want to apply to others “this didn’t start on…” “this has been going on since -“ and “this didn’t happen in a vacuum,” yeah well don’t speak about the 1917 Lord Balfour Declaration without mentioning Armenia and 1915, or about Theodore Herzl and political Zionism in 1897, without mentioning the Hammidian Massacres of 1893, or talk about the modern Zionist migration movement from 1882+ without mentioning the Turks’ “Crime of The Century” from their 1870s brutalization of Bulgaria during her war of independence.",

    "body": "That last part, tho 🫥  \nBro. Broo. Broooo your deflection is so unreal, and unserious….  \n\nI was literally telling y’all about how when you and I were small children 20 years ago, we could’ve gone and vacationed around the region but especially in the disputed territories, and seen great grandmothers, grandmas, or older moms in the hands of Arab families who either they themselves were taken/stolen, put up for sale/bought/, or “rescued” / “adopted” by local Arabs from the land of Israel.   \n\nLike if you go into photograph collections and family records of Arabs from Israel and the disputed Israeli territories in the year 2000 on the eve of the 2nd intifada, and seen images or archives from 1947 when the British were still in rule, or in 1949/50 after Jordan and Egypt had illegally seized, stolen and repossessed what they could, you can find that anywhere from at least 1 in 10 to as many as 1 in 6 of the (older) Arab women in Israel in the middle and latter half of the 20th century happened to have been “married into the family tribe/culture” or were of “uncertain origins” and “probably was adopted / came from an orphanage” between the mid 1910s-early 1930s.   \n\nOr, in the best case scenario, they were taken or bought from local Transjordanian and Judea &amp; Samaria / “West B*nk” families of Samaritan origin, false Samaritan converts to Islam, Judeo-Christian or Judeo-Catholic forced converts, and Crypto-Jews of Arab identity who superficially adopted Islam.  So no, what the ottoman genocidal government and her local populace did, in fact DID happen everywhere in the Near East and Levant, and at the exact same time, like what are you even talking about? The dates correspond exactly, the ones I was referencing.   \n\nFrom the 1870s to the 1920s, which the rise of Balkan nationalism and independence movements, to the transfer of power from Turks to Brits in the southern Levant / ‘lower Syria.’  Just bewildering. Crazy.   \n\nIdk what’s up with this supernatural power coming over you wanting to protect and shield the most violent of people from legitimate, historically accurate portrayals of their verifiable involvement in carrying out a mass genocide of their neighbors that happened to come before, and during the rise of Zionism, and deny all claims of culpability.   Like bruh. This must be a fetish, helping to let criminals get away with the fruits of their labor - - spoils of war and gains from crime.  \n\nHow is, the Middle East having been about 25% Christian by the early stages of political, nationalistic Zionism in the 1880s, then NOT, today, not showing a decline in the percent of Christian population there today?  \n\nThey are just 2-4% today, that’s a lot more than over 24% from just 140 years ago.  \nAnd objectively, in massive demographic decline in any stretch of the imagination, by any rubric you measure by or standard you hold them to.  \n\nAnother perplexing strawman fallacy falling flat on their face terror-supporting, bewildering, crazy and perverted, fetishistic statement outta youse, boi.  \n\nAs to your last paragraph, \nyou’re lying yet again and your bigotry, prejudice, bias, discrimination, preference, favoritism, outright racism is showing through your teeth and pouring out of your lips, spilling down the side of your mouth again.   \n\nEvery last thing you said is an inversion, an inversion of reality.  It is YOU people who always say “this didn’t start on October 7th” or “this happen in a vacuum” (‘history’),  \nit is YOU people who say “this all began with the [[insert random, whatever claim]]” or “this wouldn’t have happened, had it not been for [[insert more random allegations]]”  \nand especially the all-time classic “well, what did you expect to happened? After the Baalestinians have had to go through [[ahistorical and completely inaccurate description of cause and effect]]” (‘they started it’)  \n\nand most of all, if is YOU people who never cease with the “settler, colonizer, invader, foreigner, land thieves, imperialists” blood libel and say “Go back to Europe! /Poland, Hungary, Ukraine, Russia, Khazaria” etc (‘they have other countries’ / came from and can go somewhere else / are not from here / don’t belong here).  \n\nThere is no argument that Israel or any other established country has or does not have a right to exist, she just does. And of course that must remain un-challengeable. She must never cease or be made to cease, and simply be allowed to be.   \n\nYou can’t give an abortion to a post partum patient, a mother with a live baby out of her womb and into her hands, arms, that she is breast feeding. You’d be some four-seven months much too late for that, boo.  \n\nThough I do know you like the idea of 530,000 Sudanese children dying of actual starvation and dehydration in a real famine that you magically all get to sweep under the rug while yelling and screaming, shouting and hollering about “international” law, “universal” human rights, and “global” democratic norms” or “fundamental” access to humanitarian aid and medicine. Not for everyone, apparently, and again that’s even according to your own rubric 😅   \n\nat least in conservatives and nationalists case like my team, we openly say and acknowledge we don’t care about each and every single part of the world and care what happens to every one of the other 8 billion people on here, but we don’t say one thing and then do another as you radical ultra far left Leftist, Socialist, Marxist, Communist, Anarchist, witchcraft practicing creatures of the night who,   Say and claim, allege that you’re not racist, and not anti Jewish or antisemitic, but rather “just” think of it JUST (singularly, exclusively, only here and only now) antizionist and anti Israel, but you folk do everything you can to put her as one country, with some of the lowest casualty rates in combat all other 192 countries and when someone does calls out other instances of oppression that you say you and pretend to care about, you call it a “deflection” or “cover up” and think of it as some secretive, master conspiracy by the Mossad to “let Da Jooz get away wit it he he he Tee-Hee! Michael Jackson style”  \n\nYou can’t destroy countries you don’t like or disagree with, and not when it’s commie ritual sacrifices who rub their hands together and smack their licks, reveling in the slaughter of 4.7 million middle easterners, Africans, and Asians since 2001, OUTSIDE of Israel but will deflect to Israel from, as to ensure that every single Muslim majority and Islamic plurality country, 57 of 193, can continue to kill another 5,000,000 people in the next 25 years and your Commie Kind can lick their lips some more knowing that although in these countries you have nothing at all that you agree with other than differing degrees of socialism and Marxism, well at least there’s no capitalism or World Central Bank or American involvement cuz imperialism and colonialism, and also wHiTee MaN bAad.",

More than 300K or 40% of the 700K left by May, nearly all of their own volition from land not held within future Israel or inside of Israel proper but without the use of violence or even a recorded threat of utilizing force imminently.     And no homes were taken, property seized, that wasn’t in the form of evictions from new landlords who purchased the land normally from willing sellers and were PERFECTLY within their rights to refuse to rent to whomever they wanted for whatever reason they deemed fit.   \n\nJust as I’m sure you wouldn’t rent a place out to MAGA supporting Trump voters, Hungarian fans of Orban, or Argentine lovers of Millei.   \n\nMassacres are never defendable, justifiable, excusable, rational, forgivable, pardonable, or otherwise acceptable. Full stop. I’d never claim them to be so. Full stop.  But, you better be very careful to do that bit of extra research and be certain that whatever instances you’re thinking of or conjuring up are actually, universally accepted as a demonstrably provable, ascertainably credible case of a “massacre,” and it just that as is usually the case, your side refuses to be normal brained and like regular human beings with a soul who create army bases, Air Force bases, navy bases, marine bases, espionage bases, SWAT or national police bases, national guard bases, coast guard bases, but rather be a guerrilla and launch attacks from private homes or public institutions which are then stripped of immunity from strikes and considered legal targets, per international law.   \n\nA term you Commie people like to bring up so much and over use, but of course doing the furthest, most remote thing from applying it across the board “internationally.” Liyah liyah pants on fiyahhh.  You neglected to mention the military rule is on account of their, erm, consistent military rearmament and actively initiating the reengaging on the battlefield of live combat, being revolutionaries and resisting to comply with the imposed conditions of their loss, or even accept defeat? 🫤  \n\nYou forget don’t you hun, that when you, for better or worse, are defeated in battle in all other 192 countries in the World, and for all of humanity’s existence, a winning army wins the right, through blood and sacrifice, of rightfully imposing conditions unilaterally?   \n\nOh but right, all of world history up to now and every one of the other 200 or so nations doing so doesn’t count, bcuz iss Da Jooz, mane.  And there is no occupation, Israel is not occupying any land. Simple as. 👇🏼  \n\nShe is inhabiting and administrating, holding and partially controlling land, but its land that is hers or has not been deemed to be own by or owed to, another peoples.   \n\nAfter all, she gained that land, land originally meant to be hers in 1917/1920 anyhow, then again originally all hers in 1949 when the other side of a partition plan rejected the deal but she in her good graces chose to not pursue, but then won legally through the Right of Conquest from the ‘67 Six Day War.   The land was originally Jordanian annexed and Egyptian managed / puppet state-ed. There are no modern day, current 2026 Jordanian or Egyptian governments who want it. Who, I ask you who, as a responsible party which won’t wllow, she simply mustn’t let, yet ***another*** fundamentalist theocratic, extremist athorotarian, radically tyrannical, terrorizing Islamist or supremacist Islamo-fascist regime having state come into being (because lord knows the very last thing we all need is a single one more of those), would she even give it back to? It is by definition, impossible for anyone other than Israel to hold claim to it.   \n\nYou play stupid games, you win stupid prizes - - play with fire, you’re gonna get burned. And no takesies-backsies. I hope that was in easy language simple enough for you in terms you’d understand, sweetheart ☺️",

Islamic Modernism thinkers like Mohammad Abduh had a greater influence on Arabs than Arab nationalists, who called for modernizing Islam.  While their message was anti-imperialist, they were more focused on modernizing Muslims rather than kicking the European out.\n\nHowever, this changed when the Young Turks seized power in 1908 through the Young Turk Revolution of 1908.    The Young Turks implemented many secularizing reforms, but also tried to make the Ottoman Empire more Turkish. They wanted to make Turkish the national language of hte Empire, whereas before it was the language that was most used in a particular region. The initial response of most Arab leaders was to oppose the Young Turks on the grounds they were undermining the Islamic nature of the Caliphate. In response, this is whatthe  Arabs did\n\n&gt;In 1911, Arab intellectuals and politicians from throughout the Levant formed [al-Fatat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Fatat) (\"the Young Arab Society\"), an Arab nationalist secret society and club, in Paris. Its stated aim was \"raising the level of the Arab nation to the level of modern nations.\"[^(\\[27\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_nationalism#cite_note-27) In the first few years of its existence, al-Fatat called for greater autonomy within a unified Ottoman state rather than Arab independence from the empire. \n\n[One concern the Arabs had was that they were unrepresented in the Ottoman bureaucracy](https://www.jstor.org/stable/164733?read-now=1&amp;seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents),  in the Ministry of Finance of the capital there were no Arabs in the Ministry.\n\nOne of the reasons why the Arab Revolt of 1916 occurred was that Arabs didn't want to be conscripted to fight for the Ottomans in the Balkans or Crimea.\n\nYou make it appear the Arab arew savage, blood thirsty, and expansionist.  Even though Jews were also conscripted, being non-Muslim,m they usually kept Jews away from the front lines.\n\nThe literacy rate of the Arabs in the Ottoman Empire was about 10%, most couldn't write their own name, let alone understand why they were being sent to fight in Europe.",

Ashkenazi history is important, but the Mizrahi are now effectively the largest Jewish group in Israel and their history is the real history of how Israel was formed. \n\nIt's true that the Mizrahi were spread over much of the Middle East by 1900, but it's important to remember that that was all part of the Ottoman Empire. In other words, they were effectively still in the same country as Israel was part of. They survived Arab conquest and horrible mistreatment. Where people make up stories of Apartheid nowadays with little real basis (no, it's not Apartheid to treat citizens differently from non-citizens), they were, and in cases where they remain in other Middle Eastern countries, still are subject to real Apartheid under the Islamic Dimmi system.",

Ashkenazi culture includes large parts of Jewish culture derived from the Jewish religious texts.

The Palestinian ‘resistance’ chose to respond with 140 suicide bombings instead of making a deal.  Many people out there may not care about those Israeli civilian lives, fine I wont try and convince them on that point.  But I think they should care about the terrible impact of that choice on Palestinian civilians.  \n\n-Secondly, America had troops in a  foreign country thousands of miles from home, it was easy enough for them to just disengage and go home, at a terrible cost to Afghan’s who value personal freedom.  Like it or not, millions of born Israelis now live in Israel and they will not voluntarily vacate their only home to go back to countries they were violently forced out of, especially the million or so refugees from Middle Eastern countries. \n\nOne person’s terrorist is another’s freedom fighter, I don’t expect Palestinians to ever view Ben Gurion as we do, just as we’ll never view Arafat or Sinwar as many of them do.

In the 1990s when Fatah accepted they got an autonomy.  I did a detailed post on what Oslo actually was: https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/d365iz/what_was_oslo_evolution_of_autonomy_not_statehood/ . Israel never agreed to Soviet Plan (later the UN Plan) of the 1930s/40s hard partition being revived into a \"two states\" along 1967 borders.  However, the autonomy had tremendous powers after Oslo Israel made substantial concessions they never before offered.  And then over the next 4 years made further concessions.  What Fatah got was substantial actual progress towards Palestinians living under self-governance in more and more areas.  \n\nThen of course the 2nd Intifada happened, we started to see a reversion, followed by Arafat's death.  Abbas is a less decisive leader, was less inclined towards a final settlement and negotiations faltered badly.  So yes at this point the PA is seen as worthless or troublesome by many Israelis,  and Israel might decide to just disband it. \n\n&gt; well you know that a government supported by the us mean a government ruled by the us.\n\nTrade is based on giving up something in exchange for something of more value.  Going along with the USA is part of accepting to be in its sphere.  One trades some policy concessions for not experiencing the effects of a hostile relationship.  Afghanistan 2001-14 is a terrific example.  Things in most areas got much better for Afghans in exchange for policy concessions that Afghans wouldn't do absent those advantages. \n\n&gt; So what will happen if the USA wanted a piece of Afghanistan like they want Greenland now ? \n\nThe USA doesn't want Greenland now.  Trump does.  I'm hard pressed to think of many in Congress who want Greenland.   Randy Fine is probably the most supportive of the policy and even he advocates negotiations with Denmark not war.\n\n&gt; And obviously international law doesn't apply on them, so who will stop them if the USA decided that\n\nWho would stop the USA if it decided to take Greenland by force?  No one.  The USA has a stronger military than the rest of the world combined.  It achieves that with a fairly low level of military spending relative to what it could achieve.  The USA is capable of ruling the world through force and terror rather than persuasion and soft power.  The USA as an empire has traditionally favored a soft approach.  But were the USA to shift to a hard power approach while there would obviously be resistance, it likely would be successful but costly for a century or more. \n\n&gt; I'll tell you who, it's taliban\n\nThe United States achieved its main objective in Afghanistan the removal of Al Qaeda.  Are failure in Afghanistan came from Bush never having gotten agreement for colonizing Afghanistan.  Had the USA treated it like Alaska, Hawaii... the Taliban would have been defeated.  The USA just didn't care enough to fight for decades and the Taliban were able to make Afghanistan annoying. \n\n&gt; History show us that living in a bad economy is better than relying on the us support\n\nHow does history show that?  You pointed to an example of a disastrous rule with terrible policy consequences in exchange for what in your mind?  Getting to make defiant proclamations?",

But at the forest-level, the point of the response will be *I don’t like how he makes me, and any of the people in my world, feel. And because he has no legitimacy among anyone I know or care about, I’m properly dismissive of any of his hot takes.*\n\nIn my research and my personal experience, building a statement of fleeting feeling, completely out of statements of brute fact, is much more the done thing in Arab cultural settings than Anglo or Israeli ones. It’s easy for Westerners to mistakenly think their Arab conversation partner is debating and clarifying matters of factual truth, when in fact he’s obliquely, and with much hyperbole, simply expressing how he strongly feels, right now, no more no less. Expect two sets of ostensibly factual statements from the same person to contradict each other, once the person’s feelings on the subject have changed.\n\nIt’s a very different conversation dynamic, which reveals a very different cultural priority. Generally speaking, Westerners and Israelis would rather hear and know the objective truth, even if they don’t like how it makes them feel right now. And generally speaking, Arabs and many other Easterners would rather feel good and strengthen the bonds with those they love and care about by making them feel good right now, even if this means everyone misses important objective truths.\n\nIf the apocalypse was tomorrow, would you rather survive alone, or go down together with everyone you loved? All people might want the same basic things. But people differ markedly in what things take priority over what others.",

Basically, Palestine and Palestinians would have been fine with being part of any surrounding arabic state. Palestinians weren't overly concerned with which nation they'd be a part of so long as it was arabic and didn't encroach on where they lived (eg. They wouldn't be losing their homes).\n\nAfter the Six Day War pan-arabic nationalism lost favor in the arabic world and gave way to radical Islamism. The failure to secure Palesine and kick out Israel, along with Israel actually making territorial gains as well as Palestine not really having a state at all ushered in Palestinian national sentiment. Palestine before 1967 could be looked at more like a province of arabic states rather than a full on nation. However after 1967 the conditions were set for a unified Palestinian national identity given the failure of pan-arabic nationalism/rise of Islamism as the dominant ideology, surrounding arabic nations effectively de facto giving up their claims on Palestine which essentially removed Palestine and Palestinians as being included in any arabic nation, and the shared hardship that Palestinians were going through^1.\n\nOne thing you'll find when studying how national identities are formed is a shared sense of harship/struggle/issues for that group of people that make it uniquely \"theirs\". You can think of it like how soldiers in military units form very tight bonds with each other but on a national scale. Separatist movements also get their national identities out of existing grievances/issues/conflicts as another example. Ukraine's national identity surged about Russia invaded, as did Israels after their first war, etc.\n\nPalestine as a unique group had always existed, but thst Palestinian identity was never really at the forefront or important *until* those other conditions were met, which is why it took until after 1967 for that identity to take root.\n\n[1] I use harship because this is about how Palestinians came to have their own national identity so it's going to have to be from their perspective.",

Already mentioned was Egypt's little protectorate/government/legislative council (third times the charm), and of course one would be remiss not to mention the hashemite monarchies solution, which was declaring Transjordan and Palestine one state and one people. That bit them in the rear for decades after '67 in some really funny ways (half the parliament being reserved for constituencies that quite literally could not vote, on account of being controlled by Israel), heck it still does.\n\nI think your question is more this: why didn't they just take the land of mandatory Palestine behind their side of the armistice line and constitute it as an \\*independent\\* state? Well, you know when someone complains about how many arab states there are? A good few arab states would have agreed at the time, but not in the same way. I mean we look at Jordan, Palestine \"Syria\", Iraq, sort-of Lebanon it depended who you asked (sunni's hard yes, Maronites hard no), it was all just Syria and they were all wayward provinces of the legitimate Syria, which wasn't necessarily \\*Syria\\* Syria. And then there's Egypt, who saw \\*everyone\\* as wayward provinces. So it of course follows: why constitute a new independent state when the independence of everyone else is already illegitimate? So in that '48 to '67 period most what to do on the Palestine issue was basically just power games between who was going to get to be the real and real big Syria, and of course Nassers Egypt jumping in with bigger goals and bigger guns but lesser brains.",

Heck, even the PLO was pan-Arabist until the late to early sixties and seventies. The only exception I can think of right now is Jordan and Saudi Arabia, although Saudi Arabia especially was anti-Zionist as well. Jordan never really was. Nationalism only became more accepted after the death of Nasser and subsequent Black September.\n2. You can't really have a state when another nation already annexed the land. Jordan annexed the West Bank shortly after the 1948 War. In other words, Jordan fully incorporated the land into its borders and wasn't making any plans to give it up. To my knowledge Egypt kept the Gaza Strip under military occupation.\n3. Back then, the thought of Israel getting destroyed was very real, unlike the fantasy it is today. A theoretical state from the West Bank and Gaza would get in the way of that goal. It was so much easier to drive the Jews to the sea and then create a Palestinian state.

I believe you will see what I mean when your post is rewritten with accurate terminology:\n\n&gt;The UN Partition Plan provided for an Arab state to exist alongside a Jewish state. The Arabs of British Mandatory Palestine lost territory in the 1948 war that would have been part of that Arab state but at the end of the war Jordan captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Egypt captured the Gaza Strip. That territory included most of the large Arab population centres in British Mandatory Palestine.\n\n&gt;Wouldn't it have made sense for Arabs of British Mandatory Palestine to declare the Arab state in the territory that Jordan and Egypt held in 1948, while reserving their claim to the lost territories to be negotiated as part of a peace treaty with Israel? That state would have been recognised by at least the Muslim countries and probably much of the Third World and Non-Aligned Movement and, if it had made peace with Israel, everyone.\n\n&gt;Had that been done the Arabs of British Mandatory Palestine would have achieved everything, and more, that they would now settle for, namely an Arab State as part of two state solution with complete control (no settlements or Israeli annexations) of the West Bank and Gaza and with East Jerusalem as its capital.\n\n&gt;I realise that the West Bank and Gaza Strip were under military occupation by Jordan and Egypt respectively but that wouldn't stop the same sort of political action as the Palestinians have done under Israeli occupation and surely those states would have come under intense pressure to withdraw from the new state's territory?\n\nYour post presumes that Jordan and Egypt's goals were to help establish an Arab Palestinian state instead of what it more likely was: increase the territorial holdings of their countries. The case is clearly different between the motivations of the two as well. Jordan annexed what then came to be called the \"West Bank\" and Egypt only maintained a military administration and occupation over Gaza.\n\nYour post also presumes a crystallization of Palestinian Arab national identity and a widespread movement to form a nation state that had been building but was not yet in the form that we see from the 1960's onward, and it certainly was not then in the form that would have accepted the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza as an Arab state. The goal was to recapture the entirety of  former British Mandatory Palestine and either remove entirely or subjugate the Jewish population to an Arab Muslim state.\n\nIf you look at Palestinian activist regalia today, that mindset of West Bank/East Jerusalem/Gaza as \"Palestine\" isn't even present. They wear necklaces, t-shirts, headscarfs, etc. etc. all featuring the entirety of Israel, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza as being \"Palestine\". (Sometimes, strangely, even the Golan Heights too - but we can write that off to stupidity.)\n\nNow if Palestinian activists today regard all of Israel as something to be dismantled and reconquered, imagine how Palestinian nationalists felt in the 1950's and 1960's. Being isolated in the West Bank and Gaza was just a temporary setback until the Jews could be driven off and/or killed.",

    "body": "I agree with you completely. Here’s what I wrote privately and was going to re-upload. It is essentially the exact point you made, but with some caveats: “Jabotinsky’s “Iron Wall” assumed a behavioral reaction to Zionism that a Western people would have (eventually submission and thinking aligned with Western values and ideals), but he failed to realize that the Arab attachment to the land is not merely national, but religious/civilizations meaning that permanent compromise is not an option, even under the pressure of overwhelming strength. The conflict is not about Zionism being an arm/representation of Western colonialism (although this does act as a force multiplier), nor is it about the fact that Zionism represents a humiliation to the Arabs through the empowerment of a people they deem inferior (although again, this acts as a force multiplier), but rather it is fundamentally about a non-Arab nation having sovereignty on Arab/Islamic land.” I think this is an especially interesting way to look at the conflict, because it reveals that the Palestinians are not in a traditional “anti-colonial” war of resistance, but rather they attempting to essentially quell an anti-colonial movement (Zionism), whilst framing their attempts at re-colonization as anti-colonial. Obviously this is very over simplistic and I’m not going to argue that Palestinians have no rights to the land, or that they are colonialists, but rather their fight is one of an attempt to re-colonize land they once had and consider part of the Islamic “empire” (Dar al-Islam). I am still attempting to pin point whether this rejection is more prominently rooted in a general pan-Arabist sense, or a more Islamic focused sense.",

And I'll just add a small nuance to this point:\n\n&gt;but he failed to realize that the Arab attachment to the land is not merely national, but religious/civilizations meaning that permanent compromise is not an option, even under the pressure of overwhelming strength. \n\nWhile Jabotinsky wasn't accurate about the nature of the attachment to the land, and hostility to the Jews, I think Jabotinsky did view the \"natural\" attachment to the land, and the \"anti-colonial\" resentment as being very strong. So I don't feel he underestimated the Palestinian Arabs in that sense. What he was wrong about, is:\n\n1. How much the broader Islamic and Arab, and later Soviet world would support and sustain this conflict, well beyond the point it would've usually ended, in a way that simply didn't happen with any indigenous group.\n2. How much the Palestinian Arabs would come to expect that support, and for the greater Muslim and Arab world to come to their rescue. Not as an indigenous tribe, that possibly has conditional allies - but as a vanguard force of the Islamic armies, trapped behind enemy lines. Something that continues to this day, in a perpetual cycle of pan-Islamic ecstasy, fantasies of a massive pan-Islamic or pan-Arab coalition crushing the Jews, ending with Palestinian defeat, and the Palestinians feeling \"betrayed\" by nations that objectively owe them nothing.\n3. How the Palestinian Arabs were culturally primed to underestimate the Jews, especially when it comes to fighting, due to the Jewish traditional position in the Islamic colonial hierarchy.\n\n&gt; I think this is an especially interesting way to look at the conflict, because it reveals that the Palestinians are not in a traditional “anti-colonial” war of resistance, but rather they attempting to essentially quell an anti-colonial movement (Zionism), whilst framing their attempts at re-colonization as anti-colonial. \n\nOne small, fun thing I've noticed in this conflict, is that both sides used to compare each other to either the Native Americans or white colonialists, and switch between those positions even within a space of a sentence. So you have both pro-Israelis and pro-Palestinians arguing about how they're the actually the natives in one comment, and then arguing that it would be unreasonable for the Native Americans to retake the US and Canada in the next.\n\nI also noticed that this very common string of incoherent arguments died out after Oct 7, when the pro-Palestinians fully organized around the 1990's \"settler-colonial\" theory, and Soviet-style anti-Americanism. Which, of course, opens them to the attack you just described. There's no coherent way for them to argue that the Jews are settler-colonialists for returning to their homeland, while demanding to carry out settler-colonialism of their own.",

For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.””",

I had, few years back, also criticised the iron wall plan in an essay on here (although for some reason it got taken down, perhaps because I also highlighted the openly colonial nature of the plan), but my croton was for different reasons - I think Jabotinsky’s error was to plan for the moderate leaders eventually coming in and bringing the end-goal of peace….\n\n…But in my view those leaders are not able to rise up. Today’s levers of power are far more effective than perhaps previously thought - minority rule is ever stronger and whilst th common man is more likely moderate and peaceful, those in power are not and their propaganda and freedom from justice has led us into this state whereby you believe we cannot achieve peace. \n\nYou also may be making one (wrong) assumption…you say that the iron wall is necessary to maintain security. But have you considered that it may have actually turned into an iron sword, and its mere aggressive presence is what is now causing the most tension? \n\nIt could be argued that the majority of neighbouring states, regions, ethnic groups, have largely accepted the state of Israel. It can also be argued that the % of Palestinians who accept the state of Israel (although perhaps with different borders as today) is not zero. As such, we may be in the position for moderates to come in and bring peace, as Jabotinsky wrote, but violent extremist minority rule - on both sides - are preventing it, and the iron wall is adding fuel to these fires. \n\nJust my thought.",

    "body": "Thanks for the response. I must admit, that I take an exceptionally pessimistic view of the conflict and this is evident in my writings, but I would love to respond to your comment in good faith. First off, I generally agree with your thought that Jabotinsky’s main error was his hope or expectation of moderate leaders coming in and bringing the end goal of peace. I’m not going to get into my personal views about Zionism, the conflict, or anything in that realm, but it must be noted that in this conflict the Palestinians leadership has not accepted two-states for two peoples. The PLO has accepted the existence of the State of Israel, and accepts a “two state” solution, but their requirements are full right of return to Israel proper, which nullifies the very concept of two states due to the fact that this would make Israel an Arab majority state. Now, I won’t deny that Israel hasn’t offered a true two state solution either, as their offers have consistently been apartheid adjacent due to their restrictions on Palestinian sovereignty (which I actually think are understandable considering the geographic realities of deniable borders and the empirical evidence of the results of withdrawal). Now that I have gotten that out of the way, I think it is really interesting to see that the “Iron Wall” has effectively worked with Egypt and Jordan, and it makes me wonder why it has worked with these countries but not the Palestinians? Thoughts? I’d also argue that yes, the “Iron Wall” has turned into an “Iron Sword”, and Indefinitely believe it makes the tension worse, but ultimately I don’t believe it is the root cause of the conflict, as I believe the conflict is ultimately a fundamentally ideological concept of Palestinian refusal to accept Jewish national rights. This is not to say that the entire conflict is on the Palestinians, this is far from the truth, but it is interesting to note that during the peace process (and frankly at most points in Israeli history, with some caveats) there was a significant peace movement. The same cannot be said for the Palestinians. I don’t deny Palestinian hardship or plight, but I truly believe that if Israel withdrew from the West Bank tomorrow, rockets would fall on Ben Gurion airport. The occupation is horrible and inhumane, but I don’t see any alternative besides some sort of unilateral action, such as annexation with full citizenship for the Palestinians, if demographics allow it.",

For decades the situation has been dire for them, lots of internal and external forces at play, many experts, NHOs, politicians across the globe, talk about a constrained society. And we see deaths there on an almost daily basis prior to 2023. \n\nYour point about the right of return - that is a tough one. Trying to keep a Jewish state and at the sam time allowing so many non-Jews into that state, can’t reconcile those two things. I suppose it comes down to the priority of Israel and of the people who control the iron wall - Israeli statehood and Jewish majority trumps the ethics of allowing people to return to homes that their family lived in for generations and were stolen from them. That’s the bottom line. Those in power want it, so it is so - nothing to do with the morals &amp; rights of the individuals. I live in the west, we wouldn’t accept this in our current environment, so I do struggle with this point. I think, as Christopher Hitchens put it, the way this Jewish state has been created and maintained is not ideal (I’m paraphrasing and sugar-coating his words!) \n\nYour point about Egypt/jordon and why Palestine hasn’t gone down the same path. Again to my original point - either we think that the Palestinian individuals themselves are somehow unique, or we think that perhaps Israel’s created its own monster here, and its treatment of the Palestinian ‘issue’ has been less than ideal, and perhaps continues to be. \n\nWhatever our views of the decisions Israel made after 7-10, the fact is that today Gaza is ruined, and most people agree that Hamas-style attitudes have only grown in the remaining population. \n\nThat is not the state of affairs that Jabotinsky wanted or planned. Some would call that a management failure.",

Is it truly taking a crisis seriously to say someone else is ‘actually’ suffering unlike this supposed crisis?\n\n\nThe colonization, occupation and genocide of Indigenous peoples are arguably all related in the same way antisemitism across the world is related. True Argentina and China are geographically far apart and don’t have a lot of cultural overlaps, but antisemitism likely express similarly in both. Even in the past when China arguably had more philosemitism instead of antisemitism, that was really just China hearing the antisemitic things Europeans would say about Jews and their cultural values led to it being interpreted as a good thing (example: Europeans think it’s bad that Jews secretly rule the world. Japanese and Chinese people instead viewed it as admirable that they managed not only to rule the world but also aren’t even flashy about it.) \n\n\nIn that same way, when Indigenous peoples are subjected to things like occupation, colonization and genocide, you see and hear much of the same things, regardless of if the perpetrators are also Indigenous (such as the Yamato people against Ainu in Japan) or not (such as Europeans in the America). It is common to depict them as violent and savage. When they are nomadic or semi-nomadic such as the Bedouin and Lakota, it gets said that they weren’t using the land or weren’t using it ‘well enough’ and so it’s okay to take the land.

And while you're right that only one side committed genocide in this conflict, there's absolutely no question it's the Palestinian one. The Palestinian death squads have produced far more evidence of classic ISIS-style genocidal acts, that have no reasonable inference except genocidal intent, in a few hours, than Israel did in over two years of the \"most livestreamed genocide in history\". Even that quip, is literally a pro-Palestinian (possibly subconscious) admission of guilt - the only side who \"livestreamed\" anything, are the Palestinian genocidaires, who carried GoPros and phones with explicit instructions to livestream their genocide.\n\nThe destruction of Gaza is of course not genocide, and doesn't look like any genocide in human history. It looks like a destructive urban war, more humane than what the allies did to Japan and Germany in WW2, for example. And is of course a natural outcome of the Palestinian, not Israeli, strategic decision to put their entire war machine inside and under those cities. Israel would of course prefer to fight Hamas in the open fields that form that majority of the strip. In other words, even if we redefine \"genocide\" as \"when lots of buildings are destroyed, and lots of people die\", the Palestinian government of Gaza is arguably *more* guilty of \"genocide\" against their own people, than the Israelis. Who, ultimately, fought a war that the Palestinians started, in the way the Palestinians insisted it would be fought, and the Palestinians refused to end.\n\nUltimately, you're unintentionally making the opposite argument. Israel did not commit a genocide, despite over half a century of having full control over the Palestinians, and the full ability to do so. The Palestinian population only increased, at one of the fastest rates in the world. While the moment the Palestinians got even a few hours alone with Israeli civilians, they ran, not walked, to commit genocide, alongside with widespread atrocities, from gang-rape-executions to kidnapping babies for ransom. So yes, it does raise the question why you'd support the latter side, and their ability to complete their genocide. Especially if your main motivation is supposedly to prevent genocide.",

That idea is, if anything, a gross violation of the ICJ's position, since it would strip the Jews of the right of self-determination, by the same exact logic that Israeli occupation of the West Bank supposedly violates the Palestinians' right. \n\nYour answer to OP's question, is that you're pro-Palestine, because you fundamentally don't understand what the Palestinians that are fighting Israel want. I hope you understand that this is a problem.",

He calls Israel \"the enemy\" and publicly accused Israel apartheid, ethnic cleansing and war crimes. So those clowns made him president of the ICJ.\n\nIsrael didn't really want the West Bank, but Jordan launched a sneak attack against Israel, got its a$$ handed to it and ran for cover back across the Jordan River, abandoning the territory. Fortunately Israel stepped in to administrate the area and prevent further violence.\n\nYour assertion that the ICJs 2024 ruling that Israel’s  occupation (odd choice of words wouldn't you say ? Since when Jordan took the WB by force in 49 the UN called it an administration rather than an occupation) is illegal is in fact NON BINDING. It was an \"advisory opinion which is NOT legally binding.\n\nThen the UN general assembly voted on the ICJ non-binding advisory opinion, and issued non-binding resolution.\n\nComical if you ask me but whatever.\n\nErgo THERE IS NO LEGAL REQUIREMENT FOR ISRAEL TO ABANDON ITS ADMINISTRATION OF THE WEST BANK.",

Going to Pali rallies is a chance to engage, being pro-Pali is an excuse to be \"on brand\", get likes and getting to know people.\n\nMost of them couldn't handle a proper conversation/discussion as to very long history of the conflict, they just throw \"genocide\", \"nakba\", and \"etnic cleansing\" now and there for the sake of it, they are 5' of asking: \"is that it? Did we fix it...?\". I'm not saying all of them are like that but a lot of them, especially the fanatical ones on demonstrations are. \n\nIronically the proved my point very easily after the ceasefire since most of them moved on to the next shiny thing, even Greta Thunberg wanted to be considered like an eco warrior or something is very silent about what goes on Iran, or has not organized any fleet to go there, perhaps she is less naïve than we all think and she is fully aware she is not going to get the same treatment as the Israelis gave her.",

Iran does fund Hamas and it becomes a dilemma of whether or not Hamas can sustain itself or protect against the occupation without the help of foreign countries. But I’m consistent with my beliefs and Iran should be free WITHOUT Western intervention or Israeli intervention because everytime the U.S. has done that we installed a tyrant or dictator more friendly to Western policy or imperialism.\n\n2.

Queers for Palestine aren’t Chickens for KFC come on. Outside of Tel Aviv, a lot of LGBTQ people actually think that treatment of them is sub-par and not good. Hamas doesn’t throw gay people off roofs, that was an ISIS execution and ISIS and Hamas are enemies as well as different groups.

I've never encountered any serious Christian Zionist teacher or book claiming that Jews need to gather in Israel so they can all die horribly while Christians get raptured to heaven, and honestly that's such a cartoonish misrepresentation that it makes me wonder where you even got this idea from because it sure wasn't from actually reading what these people believe. The actual theological framework most Christian Zionists work from comes straight out of the Tanakh (books like Zechariah and Ezekiel written by *your* prophets) which prophesy that in the last days Israel will be restored, attacked by nations, and then God will personally intervene to defend them and judge the world based on how they treated the Jewish people, and plenty of Christians also draw on their own scriptures which predict that *Christians* (not Jews) will face severe persecution before Christ returns, so if anything the shoe's on the other foot regarding who's supposedly dying horribly.\n\nYou're also confusing the rapture with the second coming which suggests you don't actually understand the eschatological framework you're critiquing, and not even all Christian Zionists believe in a pre-tribulation rapture anyway so you're attacking a position that isn't even universally held among the group you're criticizing. What's really going on here is that many Christians support Israel for the same reasons other Westerners do (shared democratic values, common threats, cultural affinity) and yes some *also* have theological reasons rooted in believing that God's covenantal promises to the Jewish people still stand, but reducing that to \"they want us all dead so they can go to heaven\" is exactly the kind of bad faith misrepresentation that anti-Zionists use to drive wedges between Israel and one of its most reliable support bases. You can disagree with Christian eschatology all you want but at least represent what people actually believe before you call them creepy, because right now you're essentially repeating talking points designed by people who want to isolate Israel by convincing Jews that their Christian allies are secretly hoping for their destruction, which is both factually wrong and strategically foolish.",

Other questions are generalizations based on fair arguments. I'm not sure what the analogy for \"Zionist is a slur\" - that Islam has bad rep? Let's try to answer your Q's:\n\n&gt;palestinians are squatters on jewish land\n\nSaid by those who believe the land is Jewish either because it used to be ruled by Jews (historical precedence) or the providence of God to the Jews (religious doctrine). The former is fallacy (right by might and the Jews lost), and the latter is stupid - unless you're religious, in which case you just believe whatever you want.\n\n&gt;palestinians are arabs from arabia, jordan, and egypt\n\nIt's an ignorant take - the Arab conquest Arabized the locals, it didn't replace them with Arabs. I think it doesn't matter because the Arabs that are in Palestine today are Palestinians enough, for all intents and purposes. But it wasn't always the case.\n\n&gt;palestinians are a fake people\n\nProbably rooted in the Palestinian nationality being a recent concept. The first *Palestinian* Arab congress took place in 1919. The local elites defined their \"Palestinian\" identity thusly:\n\n&gt; We consider Palestine nothing but part of Arab Syria, and it has never been separated from it at any stage. We are tied to it by national, religious, linguistic, moral, economic, and geographic bounds\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Syria\n\nIdentities evolve and so do national identities. It took decades past this point for the modern Palestinian identity to coalesce, and I believe it wouldn't have become distinguishable from Syrian or Pan-Arab identity had it not been for the Jews emerging as a local sovereignty, while the rest of the Arabs were defeated in claiming the land and its inhabitants for themselves.\n\nI'll remind you that, in the decades following Israel's creation, Egypt, Jordan and Syria invaded Palestine to claim it for themselves, not to \"free the Palestinians\".\n\n&gt;\"muslim behavior is the reason for islamophobia\"\n\nA generalization ignoring bigotry and racism. But let's look at some dry statistics:\n\n\\- All Arab states are dictatorships\n\n\\- Islam is the dominant religion in the world's most violent countries\n\n\\- Islam is the dominant religion in global terrorism\n\nCombine these 3 with Islam's expansionist doctrine and natural demographics, and you've got a good reason to fear Islam.\n\n&gt;\"why should palestinians get western treatment when they behave like animals\"\n\nThis is a bit of a generalization, and I don't know about \"animals\", but *collectively*, Palestinians do not adhere to Western values. The idea that Palestinians would somehow erect a western democracy, let alone sustain one, is complete fantasy and has no historical evidence to support it.",

I think they represent a brand of politics that’s insane and disastrous. I think they’re radical. If you look at their politics more broadly, it’s a bunch of conspiratorial lunacy. I think they’re a bunch of children with serious issues. They haven’t been able to overcome the fact that reality doesn’t conform to the utopian ideals Marxist professors push on them in school.",

People like Tucker Carlson have only recently made a turn against zionism but he has been an antisemite for decades spreading out right nazi conspiracies. You wont catch him saying \"the jews\" but he still is saying it. He will now say \"the zionists\" however. That did not stop him from being a trusted ally of israel and american zionists. The same went for Charlie Kirk before his death. Even Candace owens was an accepted antisemite on the jewish right before she took a turn against zionism although in her case she has since devolved into some middle ages level antisemitism.

Every country has its radicals from both left &amp; right and those radicals are known for causing massive headaches to the countries they live in at every field - radical left becomes an enemy from within - hating everything about their side while siding with the enemy a lot of times and radicals on the right push the country to conflicts, blaming everyone without taking resposibility.\n\nYou can't make those people disapear and they exist everywhere...\n\nThe reason for the problems you described is that Israel is terrible in the field of PR while its enemies (and it has a lot of them due to its location &amp; identity) are amazing at it. So you see A LOT of the ugly side of Israel that like I mentioned earlier - exists in every country, but not a lot of the good side.\n\nFor example, many people would hear about \"settler violence\" or radical sentences some people say but barely any people will hear about co-existance organizations in Israel or the co-existance (people live side by side, work side by side &amp; you can see both groups in most public areas like trains, media or markets).\n\nSo while I do get why you focus on those things since that's what you're exposed to from the outside, this is more of a PR problem than a core issue unique to Israel.",

I'm not aware of Israel publishing its reasoning, but they do have a longstanding tradition of voting alongside the USA.\n\nHere is the USA's reason for voting \"no\" as described in the document: \n\n1. The draft did not offer meaningful, concrete steps to solving the problem.\n2. It did not give enough focus on famine often being primarily manmade, the result of conflict. The way to resolve those famines is by ending the conflicts.\n3. It inappropriately discussed trade, which had already been covered in other treaties.\n4. It contained some specific line items with which the USA disagreed. Specifically, on pesticides, on climate change, and on technology transfer.\n5. The responsibility for implementing human rights obligations is on the state, not on the international community.\n\nThey wrap it up with this (emphasis mine):\n\n&gt;**The United States supports the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living, including food**, as recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Domestically, the United States pursues policies that promote access to food, and it is our objective to achieve a world where everyone has adequate access to food, but **we do not treat the right to food as an enforceable obligation.**",

The United States, working with concerned partners and relevant international institutions, is fully engaged on addressing this crisis. \n\n&gt;This Council, should be outraged that so many people are facing famine because of a manmade crisis caused by, among other things , armed conflict in these four areas... This resolution distracts attention from important and relevant challenges that contribute significantly to the recurring state of regional food insecurity, including endemic conflict, and the lack of strong governing institutions. \n\n(As an aside: it's crazy to me that this document was so poorly edited.

This is really interesting. \n\nIf there are living Palestinians doing rotten things: Whatever rotten things they’re doing have to be addressed. I’m not a pacifist. \n\nOn the other hand (and I’m writing here as a religious Zionist): The name Palestine has been around for a long time, and the living people who identify themselves as Palestinian, or as other types of non-Israeli people living in Israel and Palestine, are human beings created in the divine image of G-d, and are mostly our spiritual cousins through Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac. \n\nThey all have the same rights all people have. \n\nIf they haven’t done anything wrong, they have the same rights all innocent people have, even if they hate us.

In post-WW1 period, as Palestinians nationalism really started to gain support, most Arab residents of Palestine wanted to be part of a greater Syria, not an independent Palestine.

The concept of Indonesian was a project started by an anti-colonialist political party, Sarekat Islam, who in 1912, promoted the idea that 'Indonesian' was any person living under Dutch colonial rule in the Dutch East Indies (they were initially founded to oppose Chinese traders, but within a year pivoted to Indonesian nationalism). This arcepelego spanning concept of nationality, for a time, competed with the Island based independence movements, that promoted natavist, blood and land, concept of nationality. The more familiar inherited nationality. In the 1920-30s these natavist independence movements disbanded and merged with the arcepelego spanning nationality, both were united in their opposition to Dutch colonial rule. In 1945, shortly after Japanese occupation ended, Indonesian nationalists declared independence, resulting in a conflict between Indonesian nationalists, the Dutch colonial power (and allied countries) and well as an internal struggle, often against communists (a bit of a mess). Over 100,000 people were killed.",

In that case they mostly agree with the violent occupier.  There is nothing hypocritical about believing certain actions are justified by specific circumstances.  There are times when I think a left turn is the right move while driving, other times I don't. \n\nNow I will say that pro-Israelis do support democracy and at least in the west do support liberalization.  The Yishuv and the WZC were democracies.  The WZC is still a democracy.  When they founded the Knesset and thus the state they did it as a democracy.  Israel has a rich democratic heritage.  That's not a country you can accuse of being indifferent to democracy.  \n\nIsraelis did however run a military dictatorship in the Disputed Territories.  They tried repeatedly to found democracies in the territories.  The Village Leagues and the PA remained democracies for a time but both collapsed into dictatorships.  Israel is not the one preventing PA elections, nor for that matter is Hamas; Fatah has been the problem there.  I think Israelis are open to democracy but in their opinion the Palestinians are mostly indifferent to it.  \n\nAs far as Liberalization... Israel / Yishuv was a world leader on liberalizaton in many respects from the 1930s-90s.  Since then it has lagged.  But one doesn't become a world leader in an area with active hostility.  Israel's supporters have a phenomenal track record on liberalization in the West.  To pick an example Conservatives aren't wrong when they attribute a lot of development of feminism especially in the 1960s to Jewish Women with a shift to it mainly being a gentile movement in the 1970s.",

They have murdered over 71,000 civilians, and that number is clearly higher due to all the unrecovered bodies. 20,000 of those have been children. There is substantial evidence the IDF has targeted civilians.\n\nIsrael has thousands of Palestinians held in prisons without due process or a conviction. This was true before October 7.\n\nIsrael regularly evicts people from homes and ethnically cleanses villages, demolishes homes with an hour's notice before the residents' eyes, to make room for new settlements or for other unjustified purposes. This predated October 7 by a long time..\n\nIsraeli soldiers regularly raid Palestinian businesses and sabotage them, run over street vendors, and beat kids in the street. This was true before October 7 and is much worse today.\n\nIsraeli settler terrorists regularly invade Palestinian villages to terrorize the residents and beat them, under the protection of the IDF. This was true before October 7 and is much worse today.\n\nIsraeli terrorists and IDF soldiers often beat Palestinians to a pulp and then BLOCK THE AMBULANCES FROM REACHING THEM.\n\nIn the days of Israel's founding (1947-49), Israeli soldiers massacred entire villages, evicted Palestinians from homes and beat anyone who fought back, looted Palestinian homes, and regularly shot Palestinians for not complying, mirroring the actions of _________ (word deleted because of bot) in Europe.\n\nThis is why people think Israel is in the wrong.",

Didn't it consider them as inferior people who should only obey? Even today, Israeli-Palestinian citizens do not have the same rights as Jewish citizens.\n\nOne should admit that Israel wanted to rule and decide over Palestinians who should only obey. Palestinians protested of course, various agreements were made but they were not followed and so the situation for them became worse and worse. So Palestinians took up tougher resistance until it became what it became. Unfortunately. They did not expect it to become what it became. The original purpose of 7/10 was to show Israel that enough is enough and that the world wakes up and starts counting Palestinians among people.\n\nBut chaos ensued and so it became what it became, unfortunately.\n\nNo one was innocent, not Palestinians, but not Israelis either. I don't believe in such propaganda about children being burned, etc. Otherwise I'll start talking about how the IDF burned hundreds of people in Gaza, killed even their own, danced in front of destroyed schools, churches, how Palestinian prisoners are treated in prisons where they often ended up without a legal reason. Etc.\n\nIf I were Israel on 7/10 I would take a serious look at why it happened, would start thinking selflessly, about all people regardless of ethnic origin and actually admit that I could have acted a little differently, not harmed Palestinians as much as I did before. And certainly not killed as many as I did, not devastated all of Gaza either. And not murdered them after agreeing on a ceasefire, but I would follow in this case the 20 points the US has put forward.\n\nNote that I am an outsider and my ethnic origin is only European, not Arab or Jewish.",

    "body": "I appreciate you sharing your perspective as a European observer. It’s a complex situation, but to have a truly balanced conversation, there are several factual and legal points that need to be cleared up regarding the claims you’ve made.\n\nFirst, it is a common misconception that Arab-Israeli citizens (who make up about 21% of the population) have inferior legal status. Under Israeli law, they have full and equal rights: they vote in every election, hold seats in the Knesset (Parliament), and serve as judges on the Supreme Court. In fact, an Arab party was part of the governing coalition recently. While there are certainly socioeconomic disparities and historical tensions - much like minority populations face in Europe - it is inaccurate to say they lack the same rights as Jewish citizens.\n\nRegarding the idea that 10/7 was a protest that turned into ‘chaos’ or that atrocities were ‘propaganda’: multiple international bodies, including the UN and Human Rights Watch, have documented that the attacks involved systematic massacres, torture, sexual violence, and kidnapping. Captured documents and body-cam footage from the attackers themselves showed that the targeting of civilians was not an accident, but a pre-planned objective with specific maps of civilian communities.\n\nYou asked why the division didn’t happen.\nIt’s important to note that Israel has agreed to a two-state solution multiple times, as OP mentioned. Beyond the 1947 partition, Israel made significant offers in the Oslo Accords, Camp David Summits, and the 2008 Olmert Plan, which would have seen the creation of a Palestinian state on nearly all of the West Bank and Gaza. These offers were rejected by Palestinian leadership.\n\nRegarding the US 20-point plan you mentioned- that framework actually requires the complete demilitarization of Gaza and the removal of Hamas from power to ensure safety for both sides. It would require both leaderships to protect their civilians, something Hamas failed to do by using civilian infrastructure for military purposes.\n\nFinally, I’m not sure if you realize that Israel is a self-critical democracy. There is a robust Israeli Left and a massive network of peace activists who continuously advocate for a two-state solution and Palestinian rights. Even in the middle of a war, Israelis protest their own government and hold leaders accountable. This internal democratic pressure is exactly what allows for the possibility of change.",

    "body": "You have quite a one-sided view of the conflict and seem to have accepted only the zionist framing.\n\n&gt;Correct my statements if they are wrong as I am still learning about the war. From what I know, Britain promised the region to the Jews and the Arabs at the same time, of course this will start a war\n\nKinda? Britain committed itself to establish a Jewish national home in Palestine in 1917 with the Balfour Declaration. They also separately promised to support an independent Arab state in exchange for Arab support in defeating the Ottoman Empire. You could say that they are incompatible commitments, and in a way they are, but the important part is the actions that followed. \n\nAfter 1917 Britain worked with the zionist settlers to create quasi-state infrastructure in Palestine for the zionists and brutally suppressed the Palestinian opposition. So you can say they followed through on their commitment made in the Balfour Declaration. On the other hand, they did not follow through on their commitment to an independent Arab state. They secretly agreed with France how the region should be split between them in the Sykes Picot agreement. \n\n&gt;How would that be Israel’s fault for coming back to their ancestral homeland when the owner of the land tells you that you can have it?\n\nWell first because Britain wasn't the 'owner of the land', it was a colonial power. And more importantly because there were already people living there. Settlers coming to a place and demanding the natives leave so they can establish a state is still wrong whether or not the settlers view it as their ancestral homeland.   \n\n\n&gt;Despite this Israel tries to have a 2 state solution 4 different times. Palestine denies it every time and starts wars with Israel. Israel wins every time and Palestine loses land because of it. Again I ask, how does that make Israel the bad guy?\n\nI'm not sure what the 4 times you are referring to, but this is at best a very one sided way of presenting the history. After 1948, you have 750,000 Palestinians who have been ethnically cleansed from their homes who are now stateless. Since then, Israel has prevented them from returning to their homes, and at the same time blocked any moves towards an independent, sovereign and viable Palestinian state. In 1967, Israel invaded and occupied more territory, including the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the latter of which is the centre of Palestinian economic, religious and cultural life. It also fragmented the West Bank into separate areas cut off from each other and surrounded by new Israeli settlements, and cuts off Gaza from the rest of Palestine and the rest of the world more generally. \n\nSo the primary opposition to Israel these days tends to focus on the genocide in Gaza (obviously), and the occupation and oppression of Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. \n\n&gt;In 2005 they give Palestine gaza and what happens? Hamas uses it to build miles of tunnels and send hundreds or thousands of missiles to Israel. \n\nThis is a common misconception. Israel withdrew its settlers and soldiers from Gaza in 2005, but it didn't \"give Palestine Gaza\". It was still in effective control, so was still the occupying power according to international law and the leading international bodies. The leading expert on the political economy of Gaza is Sara Roy of Harvard, and her work showing how Israel deliberately 'de-developed' Gaza's economy during this period is required reading on this topic. \n\n&gt;What would you have done if you were Israel?\n\nThe obvious answer is \"not commit a genocide\", but I will expand on that a little. The key point is to understand the underlying cause and work to address it. Palestinian resistance has come in many forms, but at its heart its a fight against an occupying power who has expelled them from their homeland and rendered them a stateless people at the mercy of Israeli occupation and aggression. The solution is to take the difficult steps necessary to end the occupation and work towards living in peace. End the siege on Gaza and the illegal settlement expansion in the West Bank, and give equal rights and freedoms to Palestinians as Israeli Jews currently enjoy. It's a difficult process and it wouldn't solve everything overnight. But the current playbook is also untenable. It just reproduces a cycle of violence that will end with the extermination or expulsion of one group of people. We desperately need a new approach and new ideas, and that will take bravery and real leaders, not just politicians.",

By fighting for protections, laws and human rights. My own preferred resolution would be a single binational secular state where every inhabitant had equality under the law regardless of their race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, etc. You could have a specific legislature with representatives from each ethnicity, with any bill that affects a minority requiring a certain level of support from that minority's representatives, a constitution with human rights that requires a supermajority to change, a special legislative function for Jerusalem, etc.  There's a lot of creative ideas of how to achieve it - you look at other examples that have worked, learn from their mistakes, see what unique features Israel and Palestine would have, and fight to make it a reality.\n\n&gt;At the end of the day, Palestinians in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza are not citizens of Israel.

The Palestinians were never Egyptian,  even when Egypt occupied Gaza. Arabs aren't a monolith. Also, your description of the Nakba and subsequent wars leaves quite a lot to be desired.  Fundamentally, there's a group of people who are stateless and living under occupation, and that needs to end. You can disagree on whether it should end by way of a one state or a two state solution (though I think at this point, the notion of a viable two state solution is dead and buried), but you can't just pretend that Palestinians will suddenly become Jordanians or Egyptians and give up any claim to their homes.",

That's the UN and the surrounding Arab states position, but certainly not mine. \n\nI'd point out that the majority of them are recent Arabized immigrants and as such they don't have any significant ties to the land.

In this case, it just needs to be handled on a larger scale. \n\nFlatten the place end to end, keep the yellow line where it is and give the Arabs in Gaza an ultimatum, disarm or Israel will move forward to; in the North where the Yellow Line should be moved forward to at least the Netzarim Corridor and better yet to the Wadi Gaza and in the South to the Megan Oz Corridor.

A building built by the Jewish King Herod over the Tombs of the Abraham, Issac, Sarah, Rivkah and Jacob who became Israel. Later turned into a Mosque by the invading Arab armies. \n\nJews were only be allowed to go up to the 7th step as a sign of humiliation and inferiority to the Muslims.. Any Jew that passed the 7th step would be beaten and some even killed. This wasn't in the far past, this was happening until 1967. Only when the Jews defeated the Arabs, for the 1st time in 700 years they could walk past the 7th step.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cEDTMV8X8\n\n.\n\nJews were barred access to the temple mount, the holiest place in Judiasm.. not 3rd or 4th.. The holiest place to Jews thousands of years before Islam was even a thought.. since they could not gain access they prayed at the eastern wall instead.. \n\nArabs/Muslims didn't like the Jews praying there, so they placed a muslim cemetery at the eastern wall, both to stop Jews from praying there and prevent the return of the Jewish messiah who was supposed to enter the city from that side, they even blocked the gate. \n\nIt was only in the 1500's when an earthquake knocked a few buildings over near the western wall the ottomans allowed Jews a small section, about 30 feet wide to pray in, and that didn't last that long either with the Muslim community constantly attacking and killing Jews for praying there..\n\nJews would have to go and pray at time when no-one was there, since Arabs mobs would randomly beat Jews they found there.\n\n. \n\nAl-Qawuqji family.. in particular Fawzi. Fawzi served as a Colonel in the Nazi military. Later escaping to the mandate of Palestine at the end of the war.. His most famed quote \"*The battle between the Arabs and the Jews is a total battle, and the only possibility is the annihilation of every Jew in Palestine and all Arab countries*\".\n\nLater as leader of the ALA during the 1947-48 war, he decided to put his many calls to murder all Jews into actions, and was responsible for what would later be called acts of Genocide. His men had blocked all routes in and out of the Jewish sections of Jerusalem, proceeded to firebomb all food stores in the Jewish area, making sure no food can reach the 140,000+ Jewish civilians/inhabitants. \n\nHe then later ordered Cpt. Madlul Abbas to destroy the only spring/water supply to the Jewish quarter, leaving all the civilians without water or food. He also refused to allow Red Cross access to the blockaded Jewish quarter.  He then also setup snipers to shoot and kill any Jews that they saw walking the streets\n\nAs starvation set in, complaints from the Red cross and UN started to mount as well intentional pressure, eventually forcing King Abdullah to make a truce where international officials and the red cross could access Jerusalem. This was mainly triggeed after images and news of the conditions of the Jews in Jerusalem in the 7 month siege made their way to to international media. After this and several more atrocities made their way to international news, King Abdullah disbanded the ALA.\n\nThe end result of the war was the complete ethnic cleansing of over 140,000 Jews from Jerusalem, Hebron and other west bank towns, that with the previous ethnic cleansing of Jews from Gaza in the 1920's during the Arab riots made the Arabs 100% successful at ethnic cleansing all Jews from territories that they held at the end of the 48 war.\n\n.\n\nThe aftermath.. There were about 35 synagogue inside the walls of Jerusalem, most of them were built underground, because no Jewish synagogue was allowed to be above a Mosque. Eventually the ottomans allowed the Jews to build above the ground, so several larger and above ground ones were built in the mid 1800's.. then after the 48 war..\n\nhttps://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jordan-s-desecration-of-jerualem-1948-1967\n\n*All but one of the 35 synagogues within the Old City were destroyed; those not completely devastated had been used as hen houses and stables filled with dung-heaps, garbage. and carcasses. The revered Jewish graveyard on the Mount of Olives was in complete disarray with thousands of tombstones broken, some of which were used as building materials for roads and latrines. Large areas of the cemetery were leveled to provide a short-cut to a new hotel. Hundreds of Torah scrolls and thousands of holy books were plundered and burned to ashes*\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_of_Olives\n\n*some Arab residents uprooted tombstones and plowed the land in the cemeteries, and an estimated 38,000 tombstones were damaged in total. During this period, a road was paved through the cemetery, in the process destroying graves including those of famous persons. In 1964, the Intercontinental Hotel was built at the summit of the mount. Graves were also demolished for parking lots and a filling station and were used in latrines at a Jordanian Army barracks*\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Jewish_cemetery,_Hebron\n\n*During the Jordanian period (1948–1967), the cemetery was intentionally destroyed and the site was cultivated by Arab residents for growing produce. Around 4,000 tombstones were removed and used for construction purposes*\n\n\n.\n\nDirect quotes from Fawzi al-Qawuqji Memoirs..\n\n\"*These reports also indicated that the fires caused by our bombardment of Jewish installations had burnt down many of their provision stores, that the Jews were in utter despair*\"\n\n\"*the Jewish areas depended entirely on water from the Ras al-Ain position, while the Arabs could use the wells in the old city. I therefore cabled to Captain Madlul Abbas, the Commander of the Hattin Battalion, telling him without delay to cut off the water at the springs, which were in his area.*\"",

Including the most heinous of violations of international law (hostage taking of toddlers, Extermination, Genocide), or their proud, longstanding, primary strategy of either openly indiscriminate attacks, or outright targeting Israeli Jewish civilians, without any attempt to pretend to be targeting lawful targets. Or their a systematic, more or less universal abuse of international law for cover for their illegal military activities (Perfidy, Human Shields), that are the direct, intentional reason for the heavy death toll and destruction on *their own* side. And from an ad bellum perspective, the completely illegal, openly stated goal of conquering the state of Israel and annexing it to Palestine, followed by stripping the Israeli Jews of their inalienable right of self determination at best, and complete destruction of the Israeli Jews at worst.\n\nUnlike Israel, Hamas/PIJ don't even pretend to follow the LOAC or IHL, have no equivalent of the Israeli MAG, military courts, or the IAF legal advisors for every strike, any judicial review of international law violations by Gazan courts (which, to be clear, did exist), or anything else that would even remotely seem like a desire to comply with international law. And if anything, the Hamas government loudly praise and reward the most criminal of behaviors by their members, if they don't simply order it outright, while making slick propaganda videos boasting about their systematic, unquestionable criminality.\n\nFinally, as OP correctly pointed out, the fact any Gazan civilians were killed at all in this particular conflict, and any Gazan homes were destroyed, is a direct result of criminal choices made by Hamas, and forced on the Israelis against their will. The choice to start this war of aggression to begin with, by invading Israel and committing Genocide (or at the very least Extermination, hostage taking, gang-rape-executions etc.) in peaceful Israeli Jewish communities. The choice to illegally place their entire war machine under and inside people's homes, schools, hospitals, mosques and other civilian objects, and while refusing to wear any distinguishing marks while fighting (as opposed to revolting parades of hostages, for example), and generally building their entire defensive strategy on abusing international law and maximizing their own civilian casualties. Finally, they made the choice to not end the war for two years, by refusing to comply with their legal requirement to immediately and unconditionally release all of their hostages, and stand trial of their crimes - or even accept the generous pardon and exile that the Israelis offered them.\n\nAnd of course, the far more nuanced violations of international law by Israel, simply cannot absolve Hamas of their legal responsibilities, both to Israelis and their own population.\n\nThe fact is, from the perspective of international law, this is still very much a \"both sides\" issue - with the Palestinian side being significantly worse, on every imaginable level. OP talked about a \"middle road\", and your attempt to swerve hard into the \"but Israel is bad\" side, is simply not justifiable.",

With essentially no attempt whatsoever to follow international law, nothing that comes even close to the Israeli attempts to do so (however deficient you mind find them). And if anything, the Palestinians have a longstanding strategic policy to completely flaunt any obligations they might have under IHL (and international law period), only taking note of IHL when they intentionally abuse it, and this policy forms the core of their military strategy.  And when talking about the recent Gaza conflict, the Palestinian criminal choices are the main driving force behind the suffering and death inflicted on both Gazans and Israelis. So again, trying to take OP's argument about the \"middle road\", and swerving hard into \"Israel is evil\", *especially* if you justify it with \"no middle road when it comes to legal obligations\", is just not justifiable or \"serious\", on any level.\n\nAs for the second paragraph, what's fundamentally \"unserious\" is your engagement with my argument, or rather, refusal to engage with it. If Hamas didn't start this illegal war of aggression, and didn't illegally enmesh themselves within their civilian population, considerations like the proportionality of strikes on civilian objects wouldn't even come into play. Once the Palestinians did make that set of intentional, fundamental criminal choices, it's not impossible, but certainly much, much harder for Israel to pursue their legitimate war aims legally. And it's basically impossible for them to do so, without people like you simply declaring any attack that \"foreseeably killed civilians\" is automatically disproportional, a war crime, and possibly even equivalent to the widespread and systematic Palestinian practice of intentionally targeting civilians, based on the little skewed information they get from the media.\n\nThat's not a coincidence. That's literally the point. The reason why Hamas invested so much effort and money into their criminal strategy of human shielding and perfidy.  You don't get to ignore that, and wave it off with \"who cares, let's talk about Israeli legal obligations instead\".",

That is up to them but given their history we can aspire to a constitutional monarchy at best.

They need to change so much, instead of blaming pretty much everyone but themselves for the mess they found themselves in they could succeed into turning that mess into a livable situation for them and their families if they choose to bond together over anything else than hatred itself.\n\nThey lost over 10 wars in this almost 80 years conflict, and things are looking dire to them.

But let me go down to the premise here that you haven’t seen much. Firstly, the claim that we cared SOLEY because we are adverse to violence is a fringe claim. We aren’t inherently humanists. Some people here are, but this is the exception not a rule. Now, I care about this issue, but it just hasn’t come up nearly as much on my feeds. Had it not been for Warfronts the YouTube channel and this subreddit as well as a small mention on the Lebanese news networks, I wouldn’t have known about this. Additionally what is the requirement here? “You, the people who are averse to violence, why are you not watching and commenting on mass violence every time it comes up? You should be on the lookout for all the violence you don’t want to see.”\n\nBut OK I’ll play the little game this time\n\nThe Iranian regime’s reaction to the protests has illegidtimzed the government entirely. This corrupt institution has done so much harm to the people in self interest that their forceful removal of power is philosophically valid. No government should treat those it tyrannizes the way the Iranian government is doing so. Condemnation is worthy for a government to kill as many as 2500 people against the government wishes and any government who kills as many as 2500 innocents has a lot to answer for. \n\nOK, have I paid the speech tax sufficiently so that I get to actually talk about the Israel’s insistent abuse of the Palestinians, or do I have to do more performative exercises in order to meet the arbitrary quota of outrage expenditure that is demanded of me by you?",

If the country ignored Israel and didn’t actively utilize armed groups dedicated to violence against it, then Israel would largely ignore it. Algeria, a Muslim country that does not recognize Israel, doesn’t occupy a major part of the average Israeli’s mind as its foreign policy does not revolve around opposition to it. There is nothing irrational about Israel’s view here and it goes beyond the personal whims of Netanyahu.\n\nRegarding Iran, our dispute with them originates independently of Israel. One of the Islamic Republic’s first acts was to keep Americans hostage for well over a year. Again, this had nothing to do with Israel. Only a few years later their proxies murdered over 200 marines. The American conflict with Iran is incredibly complex and Iran’s opposition to Israel is but one factor. On a more personal level, Trump himself grew up in a time when Iran was a major ally of the United States and he looks at the revolution as an embarrassing example of American failure. He wants to be the one to do what a democratic administration (Carter) couldn’t. \n\nIt seems you are opposed to the reality that America is an empire and we intervene in everyone’s politics. In theory, I can sympathize with the isolationist’s fantasy of us transforming into some sort of Switzerland of the Americas but a surrender of American world dominance would certainly come with consequences that many Americans would not like. For all the complaining of the billions we spent on foreign affairs, our massive GDP (number one in the world), and our dollar being the world economy’s reserve currency, is a direct result of our dominance (economically and militarily) on the world stage. It’s worth remembering that only a few short years before we established global dominance as a result of WWII, our economy was garbage. Retreating from the world stage now would not magically let us keep the benefits of hegemony without any of the negatives.",

So if someone criticizes Israel or wishes to distance from Israel a bit more, they support Iran. This is an absolutely absurd position. Is it possible that someone could be against Iran's protests and Israels policies towards Palestine? \n\n\n&gt; If the Ayatollah falls, it strengthens the strategic position of the United States and Israel. \n\n\nWe don't actually know what will happen. Surely the fall of Gaddafi and the fall of Saddam Hussein strengthened the strategic position of the US and Israel.... Except it never did. So far what we have is the former Shahs son as an alternative. The end of Hussein's and Gaddafi's governments was handled so poorly people miss them. \n\n\nThe protestors are united against the Iranian government, but I don't see how that shows that they're pro US and pro Israel. \n\n\n&gt; Figures like Mamdani argue that the modern states - particularly the United States and Israel-are a colonial construct that must be \"deconstructed.\" \n\n\nThis is the second time you referenced Mamdami and this time you provide an imaginary quote. You do realize that Mamdami is the Mayor of NYC right? \n\n\n&gt; it is similar to how they barely supported the overthrow of Maduro, and were mainly busy attacking Trump. \n\n\nI don't know why you bring this up because it is the opposite of what's going on in Iran. Maduros government is still in place, nothing actually changed there. Trumps only priority is having a leader he can pressure to be an American vassal and to pump out oil. It is blatantly imperialistic and has nothing to do with \"humanity\". \n\n\nOverall you have the classic Twitter Goomba argument. \" people who hold Opinion A and Opinion B are hypocrites\", when there are people who hold one or the other, and you lump them in together. This whole post is arguing against an imaginary caricature. No one is quoted, and huge leaps in logic are made. ",

Your snark about \"evil communist Muslim Antifa super soldiers\" misses the point entirely because nobody's claiming some grand unified conspiracy *but rather noticing that disparate groups keep making common cause against liberal democracies even though their endgames are completely incompatible,* and if pointing out that pattern makes you uncomfortable enough to call it triumphalist wibble then maybe you should ask yourself why you're so bothered that someone noticed what side you've chosen and what company you're keeping.",

He claims that not only is it antisemitic to say Jews are less than any other group, it’s also antisemitic to say that they are equal! Jews must be seen as superior to the rest of us, otherwise it’s antisemitic. \n\nSo with that logic, you can see treating Israel like a normal country that needs to follow the same rules as other countries would also be antisemitic. \n\nAnd all of that of course assumes you agree that Israel is Jewish. Jewish people and Israel are synonymous. Just statistically, like 80% of Jews support Israel and over 70% of Israelis are Jewish. So….criticizing one is criticizing the other.",

Ok, I mean I can meet you half-way on this but it’s a bit exhausting…  \n\nThis is really confusing. So if I turn on the TV, and I see a radical settler shooting a Palestinian farmer. If I have the perspective that the Israeli govt. is not swiftly moving to hold that person accountable, it would be a criticism of the govt. Is anti-Semitic to discuss this in a vacuum without discussing the way PLO or Hamas for instance treats Palestinians? Or, equally discuss the last terror action Palestinians took against Israel? \n\nIt’s not just this post. It’s across Reddit. If there is a criticism of Israeli policy, the comments are super defensive and cast the person asking the question reflexively a being bias. Why the the topic shift away from the question/point to a discussion of bias? I don’t have this problem with other discussion topics. I’m bias towards with a criminal history when hire people. I’m still expecting an answer for a question. I hope I’m not bias against Israel, but I accept that I may be. I’m open to that.  \n\nThis is really a struggle for me. I have zero hate against Jews. You have a god given right to have the exact same rights and privileges as any other group of people, or individuals more broadly. My best friend is Jewish. I have dated Jewish women. Saying you are Jewish or Israeli does not incite any anger or discomfort for me. \n\nI’m struggling….

Liberal Israelis don’t hate the Palestinian people, but they certainly don’t trust them either, they kind of ignore them and get on with their lives (I’m not saying that’s right, but thats how it feels in Tel Aviv, less so in Jerusalem). \nIn short, criticism of the conduct of the Israeli government is clearly not antisemitic, I’m a Zionist Jew and I abhor the current government.  Being opposed to Zionism isn’t antisemitism either (many of my fellow Jews will disagree with this).  However the use of the word Zionism these days is usually an antisemitic dog whistle, and ‘Zio’ feels straight up antisemitic every time I see it (and on Reddit I see it absolutely everywhere) .  As someone else has pointed out, criticism of Israel veers straight into antisemitism with depressing frequency when people demonise all Israeli people rather than the actions of their government.\n\n  If that doesn’t land for you consider this - would you think it was racist if people abroad were harassing Chinese people, refusing to serve them in restaurants and hotels etc, due to the mistreatment of Uyghurs, or Americans cause of Trump’s bullsh*t etc.?

People on this forum are saying that the lack of criticism of Iran compared to Israel proves antisemitism, ignoring the fact that Iran is already an international pariah and more sanctions are being added as we speak while international governments are openly siding with their resistance, while protestors ask for a fraction of this to be done to Israel to no avail. \n\nOn the other hand, you do have people (like one I just bumped into on another subreddit) who are convinced that Israel faked the Bondi beach attack against itself.

Any supposed “liberal” should be rightly horrified by this brutal, repressive and hateful regime, but because so many people simply have a rabid hate for Israel, they can’t bring themselves to denounce the most obvious human rights abusers on earth. So it simply proves the “pro Palestine” crowd, it’s not really about human rights or dignity for Palestinians, it’s simply about demonization and hatred of Israel.

    "body": "&gt;First off “the river to the sea” is originally an Israeli quote.\n\nActually it comes from Arabic and it is still today called out in Arabic. In English it would be \"from the water to the water Palestine will be Arab\" or some variation of that.  But Western ears wouldn't like that so they use \"free\".\n\nFree of what exactly? Considering that in Israel everyone, including all Arabs are already free, then it can't mean free democratically or rights. The area of Israel is included in \"river to sea\", so it isn't freedom in the territories.\n\nThat means that the only meaning by the marchers of \"the river to the sea Palestine will be free\" means free from Israel in the area where Israel exists. Which is another way of calling for Israel dismantling. Which, like I mentioned, is explicitly said by the protesters. . \n\n&gt; meant by Israelis to claim ALL the land for only Israeli Jews\n\nYou see, here see how you've been manipulated. The land was never claimed by Israel \"only for Israeli Jews\". Even the Likud charter from 1977 says Israel sovereignty and explicitly gives the reason that a Palestinian state would be a huge security to Israel. Nowhere does it mentions only Jewish.\n\nIn fact, where the river to the sea be under Israel sovereignty then everyone will be free just as they are in Israel. Jews, Christians, Arab etc. all have equal rights in Israel which has been forced by the courts multiple times when minorities' rights were broken. \n\nWhy did I bring that up? Because it proves you are wrong. If \"The United States support, funding and arming of Israel is absolutely the driving factor behind anti Israeli sentiments in the US\" then the only cry of the protesters would be \"stop funding\". The top cry, shouted repeatedly should be \"Stop funding Israel\". \n\nBut that wasn't true. You didn't hear that cry. You only heard it when they are forced to justify anti-israel protests where there are no protest for \"anti-syria\", or \"anti-RSF\", ect. An argument you're repeating now.\n\nSide note:\nIt also showed how they pulled in the ignorant masses, telling them \"you, the taxpayer, is not getting benefits because all your money is going to Israel\". Which in an economic sense is a lie, as US aid to Israel is negligible in US budget. But it works, as it gives people a target to blame their financial problems on. But did the leaders of the protests make the ignorant shout \"stop giving aid to Israel \"? No. They made then shout\"Palestine will be free\" - which has nothing to do with US economy. So again, the economic hardship is just a means too get people involved, but wasn't a goal of the protests.\n\n\n&gt;I’m not European so I can’t speak for them.\n\nBut you can see how they behaved the same as in the US even when Europe didn't aid Israel. If you ask them they use the excuse it's because Europe sells arms to Israel. What about Australia? They don't even sell arms to Israel and they're were huge anti-israel protests. \n\nIf you believe the underlying reason for the protests is the support of Israel - then you're either ignorant or you're lying to yourself. It's about Israel, and only Israel. Why? maybe you should ask yourself that question.",

    "body": "I kinda agree with most of what you've said. Like im a bit sympathetic to modern displacement but overall I'd rather have jewish nationalism be in charge than Islamic nationalism. I am critical of religious nationalism but I think Islam tends to be more regressive with fewer rights than jewish or Christian nationalism. Lesser of 3 evils. Plus Judaism is older than Christianity and Islam so it kinda makes sense to me that they have an older claim and I do view arab expansion as a type of colonization. The muslims opress more groups than the other 2. I think if Islam wasnt so regressive towards progress I'd be more sympathetic but mostly I don't want them to have authority or be in charge of others. Ppl who legislate religious rules into law make me cautious/suspicious of where it will lead and I do think they want the whole world to be Muslim. If they could force us to live their lifestyle they would. Jews on other hand don't convert ppl. Israeli gov is also mostly secular. The main thing I disagree with israel on would be continually  expanding territory more recently. Like i agree they should have a homeland around Judea which is their origin point but Israel keeps expanding which I disagree with. I do think some jews opress Muslims but Muslims opress most ppl. Their laws remind me of midevil Christian laws. I'd prefer if all countries  were more secular. Islamic conservatives make Christian conservatives look tame in comparison. So I dislike Arab Muslim nationalism the same as white Christian nationalism.    That being said I dislike their leadership moreso than the average person so im sympathetic towards the citizens but don't trust their choices in leadership as in Muslim nations they keep electing extremists. There's too many negative things in the Muslim world for me to trust em to be in charge of stuff. Sex morality laws, slavery, and honor killings running rampant plus the whole wanting to convert the world even if by force make me suspicious. At least the christians stopped forced conversion. A Christian may shun u for leaving religion but wouldnt do an honor killing. Many christians worship in secret in Muslim nations. Heck even some branches of Islam keep their worship secret so other Muslims won't kill em. So on one hand I don't want their citizens to be mistreated but on other hand I don't want them in charge of anything and if we can stop them from having authority that could be a good thing. I can kinda see both sides on this. When they have self governance they opress more types of ppl than jewish nationalism does. They pretty much do what an extreme white  Christian nationalists wishes they could do if they could get away with it. I think any religious book can be used to justify atrocities like how christians justified slavery with Bible. But that was more of a thing for christians in past. Still happens but Less common today. Wheras aggressive interpretations of quoran r on the rise. Why they keep appointing extremists idk maybe the more u suffer the more strength/ruthlessness u want in leadership? Idk the why. But ive nvr heard of a progressive Muslim leader in a Muslim nation. I see it as more dangerous for more ppl to be under Islamic rule than jewish rule. Srry if this was too long.",

I agree it should exist but don't like their methods. A two state solution would be better than either side fully winning. But I don't like theocratic or placing religious stuff in government and Israel's government is secular so im always bit biased against any religion being enshrined in government. I think any religion can be interpreted for good or evil so the religion itself can go either way but when religion is enshrined in government it can go bad quickly. Government corrupts religion when mixed. And outta the dozen of countries with Islamic law enshrined most r oppressive. So im not hopeful a new Islamic state will go well. If the Palestinians wanted a secular government and/or a more progressive government I may change my stances. In Islamic states they opress anyone who isn't a straight male Muslim, they opress a wider variety of ppl. The list of ppl isreal mistreated is shorter. So im not saying isreal is great and glorious or anything like that. Just lesser of 2 oppressive systems. Plus I think when I was younger after learning about holocaust when I heard of isreal I was happy they had there own home now. As a place to retreat to. If the muslims wanna retreat they have dozens of option while jews only have 1 option. But I don't like that isreal keeps expanding so im not fully on board I just like idea of them having a place to retreat to in case another holocaust happens to em again. I challenge my views by watching videos on both sides. Though another bias I have is islam is a conversion based religion and many muslims say one day everyone will be Muslim. I've seen videos of muslims saying \" we arnt here to integrate we are here to conquer/take over\" and its hard to hear that stuff and not take it as a threat. Jews conversely don't recruit ppl. They only have 7 rules for non jews wheras muslims r more likely to impose their rules on non followers. So I don't view Judaism as something that spreads. The spread of Christianity did harm and im critical of christians who r pushy about conversion. Any religion that wants to convert the whole world is a threat to every culture that's not them. I have less of an issue with religions that don't convert. Closed practice religions only raise their own kids as religious so its less imposing. So its not just that they treat more ppl badly and their own ppl badly its also that I think they wanna spread said mistreatment on a global lv. Though ive nvr had issues with the muslims ive met irl. Its their leadership/governments/pw structures that i dislike. If there were any progressive muslim states without theocracy I'd change my tune.",

    "body": "&gt; Jews are from Israel. Most of us were displaced from there and scattered around the world, where we were constantly massacred and displaced, over and over. Due to these constant displacements, we started returning to our homeland after the 1400s (Spanish Inquisition), and the return kept amping up, especially in the 1800s (Russian pogroms) and early 1900s (Holocaust.)\n\n\nYou're lumping the pre Zionist immigration in with the Aaliyehs. Anyone discussing Zionism differentiates these movements of Jews to Palestine prior to the 1890's as distinct from the Aaliyehs. These Jews arrived in Palestine for religious reasons, they did not seek to usurp local authorities and found their own state, they just wanted to be in the land of their ancestors. They weren't thinking about re-establishing the state of Israel. \n\n\nIn other words the earlier migrants sought to integrate with the existing country, just as migrants to the US or Britain would. The Zionist migrants wanted to dispossess them of the land entirely and that's what inflamed tensions. \n\n\n&gt; During our exiles, Arab Muslim conquered the entire Middle East and Northern Africa. Then Ottoman Turks conquered the area, and then later Britain beat the Ottomans and took over. By the early 1900s, the land was mostly Arab thanks to those earlier Arab conquests — they were a mix of Arabs who had lived there for a long time, and Arabs who had just moved there to work for the British. Similarly, we were a mix of Jews who had been there for a long time, and Jews who had recently arrived. Ottomans/British were the ones actually ruling things though.\n\n\nThe vast majority of Arabs had lived there for millennia, the vast majority of Jews were recent arrivals. Not merely recent arrivals but ideological ones too; they came with the dream of taking the land for themselves and establishing a Jewish state. They bought up land, using funds they raised abroad, and then evicted the Arabs living on them. When they owned the land they prioritized their own; they hired only Jews as farm laborers and tried to create their own separate society. The British in the 1920's were firmly on the side of the Zionists and supported their settlements despite knowing how much if a problem it was causing there. Eventually this led to a revolt and unrest in Palestine forcing them to stop Zionist immigration to Palestine. \n\n\nImagine if some from the UAE began buying up Israeli land and only allowed Arabs to live on it? I'm certain Israeli society would be fine with that. \n\n\n&gt; Obviously, the Jewish desire to have 0.1% of the Middle East interfered with the Arab plans to conquer 100% of it.\n\n\nThat is such a biased way of looking at it. The Arabs weren't \"conquering\" anything; they were already there! It was the Zionists who were conquering land away and dictating what would happen. They erased countless Palestinian villages and towns, they reshaped the land so they couldn't come back after being expelled, they killed or expelled the Arabs off of it to justify annexation. If one side has to rename everything and plant colonists it is fairly clear who's conquering who. \n\n\nAlso the same thing with lumping in Palestinians with all other Arabs! Palestinians are not Egyptians nor are they Jordanian. They're not interchangeable; it is far easier for an Israeli to become Moroccan, American, German, British etc. than it is for a Palestinian to become Lebanese or Egyptian. \n\n\n&gt; So Arabs started massacring Jews in the 1920s to prevent them having control anywhere, and Jews started fighting back in the 1930s, and you end up with ongoing tribal/militant fighting. The British got fed up with the fighting and left. \n\n\nAgain with this framing of lumping in Palestinians with every other Arab country. This is why people aren't taking it seriously. \n\n\nSo Arabs started massacring Jews in the 20's and the Jews fought back. Did the Jews massacre any Arabs? Did they commit any wrong against the Arabs? What about British colonial authorities? \n\n\n&gt; The UN tried to suggest that Jews have about .1% of the Middle East while the Arabs could have 99.9% of it. Jews agreed. Arabs refused and launched a war.\n\n\nThe UN constructed a solution that gave Jews as much land as possible while retaining a bare minimum 51% majority while the Palestinian state was 99% Arab. The Jewish state even got the Negev which gave them access to the Red Sea. \n\n\nNow there were two wars, the first with Israelis vs Palestinians and then Israel vs the coalition of Arab states. The first war started before there was even the UN resolution and it arose from escalating tit for tat attacks between Jews and Palestinians. The actual instigator is debatable. \n\n\nThe second was a bit different, Israel wasn't going to encompass the entire mandate and so there was going to be a power vacuum in the rest. That was one concern for the Arab states, of course they also hoped they could destroy the nascent Israeli state as well. \n\n\n&gt; Israel basically reacts to these attacks.\n\n\nIsrael wasn't reacting to any attack during the Suez Crisis or during the '67 War or even when they invaded Lebanon in 1982. They weren't reacting to any attack when they recently took more Syrian territory in the Golan Heights. \n\n\nWhat you don't mention is the mass colonization of the West Bank, where Israel continues to displace Palestinians from their land and plant settlements in their place. What you don't mention is the ethnic cleansing Israeli leaders admitted they took out. \n\n\nAnother thing you didn't mention was how Israeli society is dominated by Ashkenazim Jews. While they bring up taking Jews from all over the world, like Mizrahi or Sephardic, Ashkenazim Jews are the wealthiest and most powerful. Arab Jews in particular were discriminated against in Israel. Every single Israeli PM has been Ashkenazim, and their ancestry traces back to a relatively small geographic area in Eastern Europe, largely Poland, the Baltics, Belarus and Ukraine. It also ties into how Israelis portray themselves; as a bastion of Western civilization against a region of backwards antidemocratic autocrats. You can claim Jewishness all you want, but the European origin of the state is plain to see. \n\n\n ",

As concubines in a harem or as sex servant chambermaids from a slave market.\n\nOh but yes sure sure, do go on about your whole idea that tenants have an inalienable right not have the lease in their contract with a landlord who quite literally owns the property they’re staying in as well as the land it sits on, expire or not be renewed.\n\nAnd I love this interesting concept about how British Mandate Jews of the 1920s and 30s, somehow were in the wrong, after having seen their Muslim neighbors help kill or enslave 3.4 million Christian people just weeks or even days earlier if not still concurrently (the Genocide of Ottoman Christians by Muslims didn’t stop until 1924 and after, with Christian slaves still being sold into 1933), for wanting to hire only Jews which, let’s be honest, as much as you’d hate to admit and love to ignore, were famously not in the business of enslaving people while conquering Syria, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Yemen, Saudia, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt and the Sinai, the Sudan, while the Arabs were doing precisely this. And in time would repeat the trend across Somalia and Somaliland, Chad, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania, Western Sahara, from the British, Italians, French, Spanish.\n\nOkay so, a little more educated now buddy? Can you please now going forward, put into context the events of the British conquest of ottoman southern Syria and the British mandate, with the Muslims’ destruction 20% of people in the Middle East in the form of the extermination of the bulk of their Christians (outside of the Egyptian Copts or the Greek Cypriots of Cyprus) ?\n\nI hope that you can remember your own words that you so righteously want to apply to others “this didn’t start on…” “this has been going on since -“ and “this didn’t happen in a vacuum,” yeah well don’t speak about the 1917 Lord Balfour Declaration without mentioning Armenia and 1915, or about Theodore Herzl and political Zionism in 1897, without mentioning the Hammidian Massacres of 1893, or talk about the modern Zionist migration movement from 1882+ without mentioning the Turks’ “Crime of The Century” from their 1870s brutalization of Bulgaria during her war of independence.",

    "body": "That last part, tho 🫥  \nBro. Broo. Broooo your deflection is so unreal, and unserious….  \n\nI was literally telling y’all about how when you and I were small children 20 years ago, we could’ve gone and vacationed around the region but especially in the disputed territories, and seen great grandmothers, grandmas, or older moms in the hands of Arab families who either they themselves were taken/stolen, put up for sale/bought/, or “rescued” / “adopted” by local Arabs from the land of Israel.   \n\nLike if you go into photograph collections and family records of Arabs from Israel and the disputed Israeli territories in the year 2000 on the eve of the 2nd intifada, and seen images or archives from 1947 when the British were still in rule, or in 1949/50 after Jordan and Egypt had illegally seized, stolen and repossessed what they could, you can find that anywhere from at least 1 in 10 to as many as 1 in 6 of the (older) Arab women in Israel in the middle and latter half of the 20th century happened to have been “married into the family tribe/culture” or were of “uncertain origins” and “probably was adopted / came from an orphanage” between the mid 1910s-early 1930s.   \n\nOr, in the best case scenario, they were taken or bought from local Transjordanian and Judea &amp; Samaria / “West B*nk” families of Samaritan origin, false Samaritan converts to Islam, Judeo-Christian or Judeo-Catholic forced converts, and Crypto-Jews of Arab identity who superficially adopted Islam.  So no, what the ottoman genocidal government and her local populace did, in fact DID happen everywhere in the Near East and Levant, and at the exact same time, like what are you even talking about? The dates correspond exactly, the ones I was referencing.   \n\nFrom the 1870s to the 1920s, which the rise of Balkan nationalism and independence movements, to the transfer of power from Turks to Brits in the southern Levant / ‘lower Syria.’  Just bewildering. Crazy.   \n\nIdk what’s up with this supernatural power coming over you wanting to protect and shield the most violent of people from legitimate, historically accurate portrayals of their verifiable involvement in carrying out a mass genocide of their neighbors that happened to come before, and during the rise of Zionism, and deny all claims of culpability.   Like bruh. This must be a fetish, helping to let criminals get away with the fruits of their labor - - spoils of war and gains from crime.  \n\nHow is, the Middle East having been about 25% Christian by the early stages of political, nationalistic Zionism in the 1880s, then NOT, today, not showing a decline in the percent of Christian population there today?  \n\nThey are just 2-4% today, that’s a lot more than over 24% from just 140 years ago.  \nAnd objectively, in massive demographic decline in any stretch of the imagination, by any rubric you measure by or standard you hold them to.  \n\nAnother perplexing strawman fallacy falling flat on their face terror-supporting, bewildering, crazy and perverted, fetishistic statement outta youse, boi.  \n\nAs to your last paragraph, \nyou’re lying yet again and your bigotry, prejudice, bias, discrimination, preference, favoritism, outright racism is showing through your teeth and pouring out of your lips, spilling down the side of your mouth again.   \n\nEvery last thing you said is an inversion, an inversion of reality.  It is YOU people who always say “this didn’t start on October 7th” or “this happen in a vacuum” (‘history’),  \nit is YOU people who say “this all began with the [[insert random, whatever claim]]” or “this wouldn’t have happened, had it not been for [[insert more random allegations]]”  \nand especially the all-time classic “well, what did you expect to happened? After the Baalestinians have had to go through [[ahistorical and completely inaccurate description of cause and effect]]” (‘they started it’)  \n\nand most of all, if is YOU people who never cease with the “settler, colonizer, invader, foreigner, land thieves, imperialists” blood libel and say “Go back to Europe! /Poland, Hungary, Ukraine, Russia, Khazaria” etc (‘they have other countries’ / came from and can go somewhere else / are not from here / don’t belong here).  \n\nThere is no argument that Israel or any other established country has or does not have a right to exist, she just does. And of course that must remain un-challengeable. She must never cease or be made to cease, and simply be allowed to be.   \n\nYou can’t give an abortion to a post partum patient, a mother with a live baby out of her womb and into her hands, arms, that she is breast feeding. You’d be some four-seven months much too late for that, boo.  \n\nThough I do know you like the idea of 530,000 Sudanese children dying of actual starvation and dehydration in a real famine that you magically all get to sweep under the rug while yelling and screaming, shouting and hollering about “international” law, “universal” human rights, and “global” democratic norms” or “fundamental” access to humanitarian aid and medicine. Not for everyone, apparently, and again that’s even according to your own rubric 😅   \n\nat least in conservatives and nationalists case like my team, we openly say and acknowledge we don’t care about each and every single part of the world and care what happens to every one of the other 8 billion people on here, but we don’t say one thing and then do another as you radical ultra far left Leftist, Socialist, Marxist, Communist, Anarchist, witchcraft practicing creatures of the night who,   Say and claim, allege that you’re not racist, and not anti Jewish or antisemitic, but rather “just” think of it JUST (singularly, exclusively, only here and only now) antizionist and anti Israel, but you folk do everything you can to put her as one country, with some of the lowest casualty rates in combat all other 192 countries and when someone does calls out other instances of oppression that you say you and pretend to care about, you call it a “deflection” or “cover up” and think of it as some secretive, master conspiracy by the Mossad to “let Da Jooz get away wit it he he he Tee-Hee! Michael Jackson style”  \n\nYou can’t destroy countries you don’t like or disagree with, and not when it’s commie ritual sacrifices who rub their hands together and smack their licks, reveling in the slaughter of 4.7 million middle easterners, Africans, and Asians since 2001, OUTSIDE of Israel but will deflect to Israel from, as to ensure that every single Muslim majority and Islamic plurality country, 57 of 193, can continue to kill another 5,000,000 people in the next 25 years and your Commie Kind can lick their lips some more knowing that although in these countries you have nothing at all that you agree with other than differing degrees of socialism and Marxism, well at least there’s no capitalism or World Central Bank or American involvement cuz imperialism and colonialism, and also wHiTee MaN bAad.",

More than 300K or 40% of the 700K left by May, nearly all of their own volition from land not held within future Israel or inside of Israel proper but without the use of violence or even a recorded threat of utilizing force imminently.     And no homes were taken, property seized, that wasn’t in the form of evictions from new landlords who purchased the land normally from willing sellers and were PERFECTLY within their rights to refuse to rent to whomever they wanted for whatever reason they deemed fit.   \n\nJust as I’m sure you wouldn’t rent a place out to MAGA supporting Trump voters, Hungarian fans of Orban, or Argentine lovers of Millei.   \n\nMassacres are never defendable, justifiable, excusable, rational, forgivable, pardonable, or otherwise acceptable. Full stop. I’d never claim them to be so. Full stop.  But, you better be very careful to do that bit of extra research and be certain that whatever instances you’re thinking of or conjuring up are actually, universally accepted as a demonstrably provable, ascertainably credible case of a “massacre,” and it just that as is usually the case, your side refuses to be normal brained and like regular human beings with a soul who create army bases, Air Force bases, navy bases, marine bases, espionage bases, SWAT or national police bases, national guard bases, coast guard bases, but rather be a guerrilla and launch attacks from private homes or public institutions which are then stripped of immunity from strikes and considered legal targets, per international law.   \n\nA term you Commie people like to bring up so much and over use, but of course doing the furthest, most remote thing from applying it across the board “internationally.” Liyah liyah pants on fiyahhh.  You neglected to mention the military rule is on account of their, erm, consistent military rearmament and actively initiating the reengaging on the battlefield of live combat, being revolutionaries and resisting to comply with the imposed conditions of their loss, or even accept defeat? 🫤  \n\nYou forget don’t you hun, that when you, for better or worse, are defeated in battle in all other 192 countries in the World, and for all of humanity’s existence, a winning army wins the right, through blood and sacrifice, of rightfully imposing conditions unilaterally?   \n\nOh but right, all of world history up to now and every one of the other 200 or so nations doing so doesn’t count, bcuz iss Da Jooz, mane.  And there is no occupation, Israel is not occupying any land. Simple as. 👇🏼  \n\nShe is inhabiting and administrating, holding and partially controlling land, but its land that is hers or has not been deemed to be own by or owed to, another peoples.   \n\nAfter all, she gained that land, land originally meant to be hers in 1917/1920 anyhow, then again originally all hers in 1949 when the other side of a partition plan rejected the deal but she in her good graces chose to not pursue, but then won legally through the Right of Conquest from the ‘67 Six Day War.   The land was originally Jordanian annexed and Egyptian managed / puppet state-ed. There are no modern day, current 2026 Jordanian or Egyptian governments who want it. Who, I ask you who, as a responsible party which won’t wllow, she simply mustn’t let, yet ***another*** fundamentalist theocratic, extremist athorotarian, radically tyrannical, terrorizing Islamist or supremacist Islamo-fascist regime having state come into being (because lord knows the very last thing we all need is a single one more of those), would she even give it back to? It is by definition, impossible for anyone other than Israel to hold claim to it.   \n\nYou play stupid games, you win stupid prizes - - play with fire, you’re gonna get burned. And no takesies-backsies. I hope that was in easy language simple enough for you in terms you’d understand, sweetheart ☺️",

Islamic Modernism thinkers like Mohammad Abduh had a greater influence on Arabs than Arab nationalists, who called for modernizing Islam.  While their message was anti-imperialist, they were more focused on modernizing Muslims rather than kicking the European out.\n\nHowever, this changed when the Young Turks seized power in 1908 through the Young Turk Revolution of 1908.    The Young Turks implemented many secularizing reforms, but also tried to make the Ottoman Empire more Turkish. They wanted to make Turkish the national language of hte Empire, whereas before it was the language that was most used in a particular region. The initial response of most Arab leaders was to oppose the Young Turks on the grounds they were undermining the Islamic nature of the Caliphate. In response, this is whatthe  Arabs did\n\n&gt;In 1911, Arab intellectuals and politicians from throughout the Levant formed [al-Fatat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Fatat) (\"the Young Arab Society\"), an Arab nationalist secret society and club, in Paris. Its stated aim was \"raising the level of the Arab nation to the level of modern nations.\"[^(\\[27\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_nationalism#cite_note-27) In the first few years of its existence, al-Fatat called for greater autonomy within a unified Ottoman state rather than Arab independence from the empire. \n\n[One concern the Arabs had was that they were unrepresented in the Ottoman bureaucracy](https://www.jstor.org/stable/164733?read-now=1&amp;seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents),  in the Ministry of Finance of the capital there were no Arabs in the Ministry.\n\nOne of the reasons why the Arab Revolt of 1916 occurred was that Arabs didn't want to be conscripted to fight for the Ottomans in the Balkans or Crimea.\n\nYou make it appear the Arab arew savage, blood thirsty, and expansionist.  Even though Jews were also conscripted, being non-Muslim,m they usually kept Jews away from the front lines.\n\nThe literacy rate of the Arabs in the Ottoman Empire was about 10%, most couldn't write their own name, let alone understand why they were being sent to fight in Europe.",

Ashkenazi history is important, but the Mizrahi are now effectively the largest Jewish group in Israel and their history is the real history of how Israel was formed. \n\nIt's true that the Mizrahi were spread over much of the Middle East by 1900, but it's important to remember that that was all part of the Ottoman Empire. In other words, they were effectively still in the same country as Israel was part of. They survived Arab conquest and horrible mistreatment. Where people make up stories of Apartheid nowadays with little real basis (no, it's not Apartheid to treat citizens differently from non-citizens), they were, and in cases where they remain in other Middle Eastern countries, still are subject to real Apartheid under the Islamic Dimmi system.",

Ashkenazi culture includes large parts of Jewish culture derived from the Jewish religious texts.

The Palestinian ‘resistance’ chose to respond with 140 suicide bombings instead of making a deal.  Many people out there may not care about those Israeli civilian lives, fine I wont try and convince them on that point.  But I think they should care about the terrible impact of that choice on Palestinian civilians.  \n\n-Secondly, America had troops in a  foreign country thousands of miles from home, it was easy enough for them to just disengage and go home, at a terrible cost to Afghan’s who value personal freedom.  Like it or not, millions of born Israelis now live in Israel and they will not voluntarily vacate their only home to go back to countries they were violently forced out of, especially the million or so refugees from Middle Eastern countries. \n\nOne person’s terrorist is another’s freedom fighter, I don’t expect Palestinians to ever view Ben Gurion as we do, just as we’ll never view Arafat or Sinwar as many of them do.

In the 1990s when Fatah accepted they got an autonomy.  I did a detailed post on what Oslo actually was: https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/d365iz/what_was_oslo_evolution_of_autonomy_not_statehood/ . Israel never agreed to Soviet Plan (later the UN Plan) of the 1930s/40s hard partition being revived into a \"two states\" along 1967 borders.  However, the autonomy had tremendous powers after Oslo Israel made substantial concessions they never before offered.  And then over the next 4 years made further concessions.  What Fatah got was substantial actual progress towards Palestinians living under self-governance in more and more areas.  \n\nThen of course the 2nd Intifada happened, we started to see a reversion, followed by Arafat's death.  Abbas is a less decisive leader, was less inclined towards a final settlement and negotiations faltered badly.  So yes at this point the PA is seen as worthless or troublesome by many Israelis,  and Israel might decide to just disband it. \n\n&gt; well you know that a government supported by the us mean a government ruled by the us.\n\nTrade is based on giving up something in exchange for something of more value.  Going along with the USA is part of accepting to be in its sphere.  One trades some policy concessions for not experiencing the effects of a hostile relationship.  Afghanistan 2001-14 is a terrific example.  Things in most areas got much better for Afghans in exchange for policy concessions that Afghans wouldn't do absent those advantages. \n\n&gt; So what will happen if the USA wanted a piece of Afghanistan like they want Greenland now ? \n\nThe USA doesn't want Greenland now.  Trump does.  I'm hard pressed to think of many in Congress who want Greenland.   Randy Fine is probably the most supportive of the policy and even he advocates negotiations with Denmark not war.\n\n&gt; And obviously international law doesn't apply on them, so who will stop them if the USA decided that\n\nWho would stop the USA if it decided to take Greenland by force?  No one.  The USA has a stronger military than the rest of the world combined.  It achieves that with a fairly low level of military spending relative to what it could achieve.  The USA is capable of ruling the world through force and terror rather than persuasion and soft power.  The USA as an empire has traditionally favored a soft approach.  But were the USA to shift to a hard power approach while there would obviously be resistance, it likely would be successful but costly for a century or more. \n\n&gt; I'll tell you who, it's taliban\n\nThe United States achieved its main objective in Afghanistan the removal of Al Qaeda.  Are failure in Afghanistan came from Bush never having gotten agreement for colonizing Afghanistan.  Had the USA treated it like Alaska, Hawaii... the Taliban would have been defeated.  The USA just didn't care enough to fight for decades and the Taliban were able to make Afghanistan annoying. \n\n&gt; History show us that living in a bad economy is better than relying on the us support\n\nHow does history show that?  You pointed to an example of a disastrous rule with terrible policy consequences in exchange for what in your mind?  Getting to make defiant proclamations?",

But at the forest-level, the point of the response will be *I don’t like how he makes me, and any of the people in my world, feel. And because he has no legitimacy among anyone I know or care about, I’m properly dismissive of any of his hot takes.*\n\nIn my research and my personal experience, building a statement of fleeting feeling, completely out of statements of brute fact, is much more the done thing in Arab cultural settings than Anglo or Israeli ones. It’s easy for Westerners to mistakenly think their Arab conversation partner is debating and clarifying matters of factual truth, when in fact he’s obliquely, and with much hyperbole, simply expressing how he strongly feels, right now, no more no less. Expect two sets of ostensibly factual statements from the same person to contradict each other, once the person’s feelings on the subject have changed.\n\nIt’s a very different conversation dynamic, which reveals a very different cultural priority. Generally speaking, Westerners and Israelis would rather hear and know the objective truth, even if they don’t like how it makes them feel right now. And generally speaking, Arabs and many other Easterners would rather feel good and strengthen the bonds with those they love and care about by making them feel good right now, even if this means everyone misses important objective truths.\n\nIf the apocalypse was tomorrow, would you rather survive alone, or go down together with everyone you loved? All people might want the same basic things. But people differ markedly in what things take priority over what others.",

Basically, Palestine and Palestinians would have been fine with being part of any surrounding arabic state. Palestinians weren't overly concerned with which nation they'd be a part of so long as it was arabic and didn't encroach on where they lived (eg. They wouldn't be losing their homes).\n\nAfter the Six Day War pan-arabic nationalism lost favor in the arabic world and gave way to radical Islamism. The failure to secure Palesine and kick out Israel, along with Israel actually making territorial gains as well as Palestine not really having a state at all ushered in Palestinian national sentiment. Palestine before 1967 could be looked at more like a province of arabic states rather than a full on nation. However after 1967 the conditions were set for a unified Palestinian national identity given the failure of pan-arabic nationalism/rise of Islamism as the dominant ideology, surrounding arabic nations effectively de facto giving up their claims on Palestine which essentially removed Palestine and Palestinians as being included in any arabic nation, and the shared hardship that Palestinians were going through^1.\n\nOne thing you'll find when studying how national identities are formed is a shared sense of harship/struggle/issues for that group of people that make it uniquely \"theirs\". You can think of it like how soldiers in military units form very tight bonds with each other but on a national scale. Separatist movements also get their national identities out of existing grievances/issues/conflicts as another example. Ukraine's national identity surged about Russia invaded, as did Israels after their first war, etc.\n\nPalestine as a unique group had always existed, but thst Palestinian identity was never really at the forefront or important *until* those other conditions were met, which is why it took until after 1967 for that identity to take root.\n\n[1] I use harship because this is about how Palestinians came to have their own national identity so it's going to have to be from their perspective.",

Already mentioned was Egypt's little protectorate/government/legislative council (third times the charm), and of course one would be remiss not to mention the hashemite monarchies solution, which was declaring Transjordan and Palestine one state and one people. That bit them in the rear for decades after '67 in some really funny ways (half the parliament being reserved for constituencies that quite literally could not vote, on account of being controlled by Israel), heck it still does.\n\nI think your question is more this: why didn't they just take the land of mandatory Palestine behind their side of the armistice line and constitute it as an \\*independent\\* state? Well, you know when someone complains about how many arab states there are? A good few arab states would have agreed at the time, but not in the same way. I mean we look at Jordan, Palestine \"Syria\", Iraq, sort-of Lebanon it depended who you asked (sunni's hard yes, Maronites hard no), it was all just Syria and they were all wayward provinces of the legitimate Syria, which wasn't necessarily \\*Syria\\* Syria. And then there's Egypt, who saw \\*everyone\\* as wayward provinces. So it of course follows: why constitute a new independent state when the independence of everyone else is already illegitimate? So in that '48 to '67 period most what to do on the Palestine issue was basically just power games between who was going to get to be the real and real big Syria, and of course Nassers Egypt jumping in with bigger goals and bigger guns but lesser brains.",

Heck, even the PLO was pan-Arabist until the late to early sixties and seventies. The only exception I can think of right now is Jordan and Saudi Arabia, although Saudi Arabia especially was anti-Zionist as well. Jordan never really was. Nationalism only became more accepted after the death of Nasser and subsequent Black September.\n2. You can't really have a state when another nation already annexed the land. Jordan annexed the West Bank shortly after the 1948 War. In other words, Jordan fully incorporated the land into its borders and wasn't making any plans to give it up. To my knowledge Egypt kept the Gaza Strip under military occupation.\n3. Back then, the thought of Israel getting destroyed was very real, unlike the fantasy it is today. A theoretical state from the West Bank and Gaza would get in the way of that goal. It was so much easier to drive the Jews to the sea and then create a Palestinian state.

    "body": "I just want to point out that some of your confusion stems from anachronistic terminology that has been introduced to discussion of this conflict in order to make history appear to be something that it wasn't. I believe you will see what I mean when your post is rewritten with accurate terminology:\n\n&gt;The UN Partition Plan provided for an Arab state to exist alongside a Jewish state. The Arabs of British Mandatory Palestine lost territory in the 1948 war that would have been part of that Arab state but at the end of the war Jordan captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Egypt captured the Gaza Strip. That territory included most of the large Arab population centres in British Mandatory Palestine.\n\n&gt;Wouldn't it have made sense for Arabs of British Mandatory Palestine to declare the Arab state in the territory that Jordan and Egypt held in 1948, while reserving their claim to the lost territories to be negotiated as part of a peace treaty with Israel? That state would have been recognised by at least the Muslim countries and probably much of the Third World and Non-Aligned Movement and, if it had made peace with Israel, everyone.\n\n&gt;Had that been done the Arabs of British Mandatory Palestine would have achieved everything, and more, that they would now settle for, namely an Arab State as part of two state solution with complete control (no settlements or Israeli annexations) of the West Bank and Gaza and with East Jerusalem as its capital.\n\n&gt;I realise that the West Bank and Gaza Strip were under military occupation by Jordan and Egypt respectively but that wouldn't stop the same sort of political action as the Palestinians have done under Israeli occupation and surely those states would have come under intense pressure to withdraw from the new state's territory?\n\nYour post presumes that Jordan and Egypt's goals were to help establish an Arab Palestinian state instead of what it more likely was: increase the territorial holdings of their countries. The case is clearly different between the motivations of the two as well. Jordan annexed what then came to be called the \"West Bank\" and Egypt only maintained a military administration and occupation over Gaza.\n\nYour post also presumes a crystallization of Palestinian Arab national identity and a widespread movement to form a nation state that had been building but was not yet in the form that we see from the 1960's onward, and it certainly was not then in the form that would have accepted the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza as an Arab state. The goal was to recapture the entirety of  former British Mandatory Palestine and either remove entirely or subjugate the Jewish population to an Arab Muslim state.\n\nIf you look at Palestinian activist regalia today, that mindset of West Bank/East Jerusalem/Gaza as \"Palestine\" isn't even present. They wear necklaces, t-shirts, headscarfs, etc. etc. all featuring the entirety of Israel, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza as being \"Palestine\". (Sometimes, strangely, even the Golan Heights too - but we can write that off to stupidity.)\n\nNow if Palestinian activists today regard all of Israel as something to be dismantled and reconquered, imagine how Palestinian nationalists felt in the 1950's and 1960's. Being isolated in the West Bank and Gaza was just a temporary setback until the Jews could be driven off and/or killed.",

    "body": "I agree with you completely. Here’s what I wrote privately and was going to re-upload. It is essentially the exact point you made, but with some caveats: “Jabotinsky’s “Iron Wall” assumed a behavioral reaction to Zionism that a Western people would have (eventually submission and thinking aligned with Western values and ideals), but he failed to realize that the Arab attachment to the land is not merely national, but religious/civilizations meaning that permanent compromise is not an option, even under the pressure of overwhelming strength. The conflict is not about Zionism being an arm/representation of Western colonialism (although this does act as a force multiplier), nor is it about the fact that Zionism represents a humiliation to the Arabs through the empowerment of a people they deem inferior (although again, this acts as a force multiplier), but rather it is fundamentally about a non-Arab nation having sovereignty on Arab/Islamic land.” I think this is an especially interesting way to look at the conflict, because it reveals that the Palestinians are not in a traditional “anti-colonial” war of resistance, but rather they attempting to essentially quell an anti-colonial movement (Zionism), whilst framing their attempts at re-colonization as anti-colonial. Obviously this is very over simplistic and I’m not going to argue that Palestinians have no rights to the land, or that they are colonialists, but rather their fight is one of an attempt to re-colonize land they once had and consider part of the Islamic “empire” (Dar al-Islam). I am still attempting to pin point whether this rejection is more prominently rooted in a general pan-Arabist sense, or a more Islamic focused sense.",

And I'll just add a small nuance to this point:\n\n&gt;but he failed to realize that the Arab attachment to the land is not merely national, but religious/civilizations meaning that permanent compromise is not an option, even under the pressure of overwhelming strength. \n\nWhile Jabotinsky wasn't accurate about the nature of the attachment to the land, and hostility to the Jews, I think Jabotinsky did view the \"natural\" attachment to the land, and the \"anti-colonial\" resentment as being very strong. So I don't feel he underestimated the Palestinian Arabs in that sense. What he was wrong about, is:\n\n1. How much the broader Islamic and Arab, and later Soviet world would support and sustain this conflict, well beyond the point it would've usually ended, in a way that simply didn't happen with any indigenous group.\n2. How much the Palestinian Arabs would come to expect that support, and for the greater Muslim and Arab world to come to their rescue. Not as an indigenous tribe, that possibly has conditional allies - but as a vanguard force of the Islamic armies, trapped behind enemy lines. Something that continues to this day, in a perpetual cycle of pan-Islamic ecstasy, fantasies of a massive pan-Islamic or pan-Arab coalition crushing the Jews, ending with Palestinian defeat, and the Palestinians feeling \"betrayed\" by nations that objectively owe them nothing.\n3. How the Palestinian Arabs were culturally primed to underestimate the Jews, especially when it comes to fighting, due to the Jewish traditional position in the Islamic colonial hierarchy.\n\n&gt; I think this is an especially interesting way to look at the conflict, because it reveals that the Palestinians are not in a traditional “anti-colonial” war of resistance, but rather they attempting to essentially quell an anti-colonial movement (Zionism), whilst framing their attempts at re-colonization as anti-colonial. \n\nOne small, fun thing I've noticed in this conflict, is that both sides used to compare each other to either the Native Americans or white colonialists, and switch between those positions even within a space of a sentence. So you have both pro-Israelis and pro-Palestinians arguing about how they're the actually the natives in one comment, and then arguing that it would be unreasonable for the Native Americans to retake the US and Canada in the next.\n\nI also noticed that this very common string of incoherent arguments died out after Oct 7, when the pro-Palestinians fully organized around the 1990's \"settler-colonial\" theory, and Soviet-style anti-Americanism. Which, of course, opens them to the attack you just described. There's no coherent way for them to argue that the Jews are settler-colonialists for returning to their homeland, while demanding to carry out settler-colonialism of their own.",

For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.””",

I had, few years back, also criticised the iron wall plan in an essay on here (although for some reason it got taken down, perhaps because I also highlighted the openly colonial nature of the plan), but my croton was for different reasons - I think Jabotinsky’s error was to plan for the moderate leaders eventually coming in and bringing the end-goal of peace….\n\n…But in my view those leaders are not able to rise up. Today’s levers of power are far more effective than perhaps previously thought - minority rule is ever stronger and whilst th common man is more likely moderate and peaceful, those in power are not and their propaganda and freedom from justice has led us into this state whereby you believe we cannot achieve peace. \n\nYou also may be making one (wrong) assumption…you say that the iron wall is necessary to maintain security. But have you considered that it may have actually turned into an iron sword, and its mere aggressive presence is what is now causing the most tension? \n\nIt could be argued that the majority of neighbouring states, regions, ethnic groups, have largely accepted the state of Israel. It can also be argued that the % of Palestinians who accept the state of Israel (although perhaps with different borders as today) is not zero. As such, we may be in the position for moderates to come in and bring peace, as Jabotinsky wrote, but violent extremist minority rule - on both sides - are preventing it, and the iron wall is adding fuel to these fires. \n\nJust my thought.",

    "body": "Thanks for the response. I must admit, that I take an exceptionally pessimistic view of the conflict and this is evident in my writings, but I would love to respond to your comment in good faith. First off, I generally agree with your thought that Jabotinsky’s main error was his hope or expectation of moderate leaders coming in and bringing the end goal of peace. I’m not going to get into my personal views about Zionism, the conflict, or anything in that realm, but it must be noted that in this conflict the Palestinians leadership has not accepted two-states for two peoples. The PLO has accepted the existence of the State of Israel, and accepts a “two state” solution, but their requirements are full right of return to Israel proper, which nullifies the very concept of two states due to the fact that this would make Israel an Arab majority state. Now, I won’t deny that Israel hasn’t offered a true two state solution either, as their offers have consistently been apartheid adjacent due to their restrictions on Palestinian sovereignty (which I actually think are understandable considering the geographic realities of deniable borders and the empirical evidence of the results of withdrawal). Now that I have gotten that out of the way, I think it is really interesting to see that the “Iron Wall” has effectively worked with Egypt and Jordan, and it makes me wonder why it has worked with these countries but not the Palestinians? Thoughts? I’d also argue that yes, the “Iron Wall” has turned into an “Iron Sword”, and Indefinitely believe it makes the tension worse, but ultimately I don’t believe it is the root cause of the conflict, as I believe the conflict is ultimately a fundamentally ideological concept of Palestinian refusal to accept Jewish national rights. This is not to say that the entire conflict is on the Palestinians, this is far from the truth, but it is interesting to note that during the peace process (and frankly at most points in Israeli history, with some caveats) there was a significant peace movement. The same cannot be said for the Palestinians. I don’t deny Palestinian hardship or plight, but I truly believe that if Israel withdrew from the West Bank tomorrow, rockets would fall on Ben Gurion airport. The occupation is horrible and inhumane, but I don’t see any alternative besides some sort of unilateral action, such as annexation with full citizenship for the Palestinians, if demographics allow it.",

For decades the situation has been dire for them, lots of internal and external forces at play, many experts, NHOs, politicians across the globe, talk about a constrained society. And we see deaths there on an almost daily basis prior to 2023. \n\nYour point about the right of return - that is a tough one. Trying to keep a Jewish state and at the sam time allowing so many non-Jews into that state, can’t reconcile those two things. I suppose it comes down to the priority of Israel and of the people who control the iron wall - Israeli statehood and Jewish majority trumps the ethics of allowing people to return to homes that their family lived in for generations and were stolen from them. That’s the bottom line. Those in power want it, so it is so - nothing to do with the morals &amp; rights of the individuals. I live in the west, we wouldn’t accept this in our current environment, so I do struggle with this point. I think, as Christopher Hitchens put it, the way this Jewish state has been created and maintained is not ideal (I’m paraphrasing and sugar-coating his words!) \n\nYour point about Egypt/jordon and why Palestine hasn’t gone down the same path. Again to my original point - either we think that the Palestinian individuals themselves are somehow unique, or we think that perhaps Israel’s created its own monster here, and its treatment of the Palestinian ‘issue’ has been less than ideal, and perhaps continues to be. \n\nWhatever our views of the decisions Israel made after 7-10, the fact is that today Gaza is ruined, and most people agree that Hamas-style attitudes have only grown in the remaining population. \n\nThat is not the state of affairs that Jabotinsky wanted or planned. Some would call that a management failure.",

Is it truly taking a crisis seriously to say someone else is ‘actually’ suffering unlike this supposed crisis?\n\n\nThe colonization, occupation and genocide of Indigenous peoples are arguably all related in the same way antisemitism across the world is related. True Argentina and China are geographically far apart and don’t have a lot of cultural overlaps, but antisemitism likely express similarly in both. Even in the past when China arguably had more philosemitism instead of antisemitism, that was really just China hearing the antisemitic things Europeans would say about Jews and their cultural values led to it being interpreted as a good thing (example: Europeans think it’s bad that Jews secretly rule the world. Japanese and Chinese people instead viewed it as admirable that they managed not only to rule the world but also aren’t even flashy about it.) \n\n\nIn that same way, when Indigenous peoples are subjected to things like occupation, colonization and genocide, you see and hear much of the same things, regardless of if the perpetrators are also Indigenous (such as the Yamato people against Ainu in Japan) or not (such as Europeans in the America). It is common to depict them as violent and savage. When they are nomadic or semi-nomadic such as the Bedouin and Lakota, it gets said that they weren’t using the land or weren’t using it ‘well enough’ and so it’s okay to take the land.

And while you're right that only one side committed genocide in this conflict, there's absolutely no question it's the Palestinian one. The Palestinian death squads have produced far more evidence of classic ISIS-style genocidal acts, that have no reasonable inference except genocidal intent, in a few hours, than Israel did in over two years of the \"most livestreamed genocide in history\". Even that quip, is literally a pro-Palestinian (possibly subconscious) admission of guilt - the only side who \"livestreamed\" anything, are the Palestinian genocidaires, who carried GoPros and phones with explicit instructions to livestream their genocide.\n\nThe destruction of Gaza is of course not genocide, and doesn't look like any genocide in human history. It looks like a destructive urban war, more humane than what the allies did to Japan and Germany in WW2, for example. And is of course a natural outcome of the Palestinian, not Israeli, strategic decision to put their entire war machine inside and under those cities. Israel would of course prefer to fight Hamas in the open fields that form that majority of the strip. In other words, even if we redefine \"genocide\" as \"when lots of buildings are destroyed, and lots of people die\", the Palestinian government of Gaza is arguably *more* guilty of \"genocide\" against their own people, than the Israelis. Who, ultimately, fought a war that the Palestinians started, in the way the Palestinians insisted it would be fought, and the Palestinians refused to end.\n\nUltimately, you're unintentionally making the opposite argument. Israel did not commit a genocide, despite over half a century of having full control over the Palestinians, and the full ability to do so. The Palestinian population only increased, at one of the fastest rates in the world. While the moment the Palestinians got even a few hours alone with Israeli civilians, they ran, not walked, to commit genocide, alongside with widespread atrocities, from gang-rape-executions to kidnapping babies for ransom. So yes, it does raise the question why you'd support the latter side, and their ability to complete their genocide. Especially if your main motivation is supposedly to prevent genocide.",

That idea is, if anything, a gross violation of the ICJ's position, since it would strip the Jews of the right of self-determination, by the same exact logic that Israeli occupation of the West Bank supposedly violates the Palestinians' right. \n\nYour answer to OP's question, is that you're pro-Palestine, because you fundamentally don't understand what the Palestinians that are fighting Israel want. I hope you understand that this is a problem.",

He calls Israel \"the enemy\" and publicly accused Israel apartheid, ethnic cleansing and war crimes. So those clowns made him president of the ICJ.\n\nIsrael didn't really want the West Bank, but Jordan launched a sneak attack against Israel, got its a$$ handed to it and ran for cover back across the Jordan River, abandoning the territory. Fortunately Israel stepped in to administrate the area and prevent further violence.\n\nYour assertion that the ICJs 2024 ruling that Israel’s  occupation (odd choice of words wouldn't you say ? Since when Jordan took the WB by force in 49 the UN called it an administration rather than an occupation) is illegal is in fact NON BINDING. It was an \"advisory opinion which is NOT legally binding.\n\nThen the UN general assembly voted on the ICJ non-binding advisory opinion, and issued non-binding resolution.\n\nComical if you ask me but whatever.\n\nErgo THERE IS NO LEGAL REQUIREMENT FOR ISRAEL TO ABANDON ITS ADMINISTRATION OF THE WEST BANK.",

Gen Z and Alpha Genes are... well, difficult people, they have troubles getting into relationships, opening up, everything hurt them (the term \"snowflake\" comes in handy here), and get their info through socials. Going to Pali rallies is a chance to engage, being pro-Pali is an excuse to be \"on brand\", get likes and getting to know people.\n\nMost of them couldn't handle a proper conversation/discussion as to very long history of the conflict, they just throw \"genocide\", \"nakba\", and \"etnic cleansing\" now and there for the sake of it, they are 5' of asking: \"is that it? Did we fix it...?\". I'm not saying all of them are like that but a lot of them, especially the fanatical ones on demonstrations are. \n\nIronically the proved my point very easily after the ceasefire since most of them moved on to the next shiny thing, even Greta Thunberg wanted to be considered like an eco warrior or something is very silent about what goes on Iran, or has not organized any fleet to go there, perhaps she is less naïve than we all think and she is fully aware she is not going to get the same treatment as the Israelis gave her.",
