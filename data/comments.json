The zionosts continued to committ terrorist acts and murder Palestinians and Brits (at this time Palestine was a part of the British empire). \n\n\nIn 1948 the Brits signed over Palestine to the zionists to create a country called \"israel\" in the Balfour declaration. The zionists began to mass-murder the Palestinians, they burned their villages, put entire families and communities in fenced areas and then used machine-guns to shoot them all in mass-murders. The zionists forced millions of Palestinians to leave Palestine under the threat of murder. We don't know exactly how many Palestinians were killed.\n\n\nSo, no. Occupation is not a good thing. Maybe in your country the land-owners illegitmately bought the land from corrupted politicians and people just try to survive by living on it. In Palestine the israelis are masd-mutdering people, they even murder children, to empty the land of people who have lived there for thousands of years. The American/zionist plan for Gaza is to build luxury hotels and luxury homes. Does that seem like something people struggling to survive would do or is it something \"big landowners\" would do?",

We force them to examine their own relationship with an obviously genocidal state and it causes them to experience extreme cognitive dissonance.\n\nClearly something we're saying is getting to them. They always get super angry at me specifically. I've been spat on by Zionists, they've threatened to hurt me, they've told me it's my fault if all Jewish people die, they say that they hope I am raped and am violently murdered etc...\n\nBut nothing I've experienced is remotely close to the cruelty and violence that the Palestinian people are experiencing. If Zionists are willing to publicly threaten violence against a small Jewish woman for holding a sign, someone they purport to want to protect, then just imagine the unspeakable cruelty they inflict on the Palestinians behind closed doors (and frankly also publicly). They can't help but show who they really are to the world.\n\nSo if my being there and being threatened by Zionists can help gain support for Palestine and help the Palestinian resistance in anyway, then good. Let those Zionists expose themselves. I imagine these men feel the same.",

Let's take the example of Orbán:\n\n1. Adopting language of the \"battle of civilizations\"? Check\n2. Refusal to compromise with regional rivals and his focus on national power? Check\n3. Not sure what you mean by an \"anti-Islam, security-focused nationalist state\" since Israel is more Muslim demographically and by extension culturally than many European countries but if Israel is, Hungary is. Check\n4. Treating the press as a Liberal enemy that targets the right and its values? Check\n5. Relevant in his country's politics since the 90s? Check\n\nAnd I would say Orbán has been way more influential on the many new European right-wing movements that have emerged or are emerging than Netanyahu. I mean, it is quite evident this is the case when you actually listen to the public conversations around these topics and movements, both online and in the real world. Ever since the 2015 migrant crisis and the birth of this \"new right\", you would see many people saying things like \"look at Poland and Hungary, we must be more like them,\" not \"I wish our country was more like Israel.\"   \nI am sure most Europeans engaged in politics at least on a basic level heard of \"some Orbán guy\" who is \"anti-EU\" and \"anti-immigration.\" On the other hand, I think the knowledge of most Europeans on who Netanyahu was prior to October 7th didn't go much beyond \"he is the president of Israel or something, right?\" Which would explain why I basically never heard of Netanyahu in public discussions prior to the War in Gaza, but I heard of figures like Viktor Orbán or even Jarosław Kaczyński quite a bit.\n\nAnyway, you have right-wing figures who are eager to cooperate and ally with Israel to fight Islam, sure. I find the notion that they *\"see Netanyahu not as a foreign leader, but as a peer-commander in a shared struggle\"* because Israel is in their eyes *\"the wall between Western civilization and barbarism\"* frankly absurd though. Sure, you could say this about some right-wing public figures I guess and you mentioned some in your post. There are also many other right-wing figures who range from openly anti-semitic to seeing Israel as some country far away which is just an ally because of current circumstances, not because of some civilizational kinship.",

I have seen another one of these posts in r/geopolitics talking about the Islamization of Turkey.\n\nIIf trump decides to capture Greenland, you can stick your Civilizational BS up your bumbum where it belongs.  Because of Greenland, the Western world will split, and Europe itself will fracture. What you will get is something that looks like Europe before the French Revolution. The Western consensus will be dead.  Some will move to the left, and some to the right.  The world will go back to the world of transactional alliances, which is the world that Trump embraces\n\nIn this transactional world, Israel will be one of the biggest losers, because you people still think in civilizational terms.  Israel will most likely have to make a deal with Iran to counter the Sunni Alliance of Turkey because the US will no longer be able project power in the Middle East once its European bases are gone.\n\nFor there to be civilizational thinking a unified civilization order culture must exist; once it breaks down, people no longer talk in civilization terms, but in national terms, with each country forming alliances, often with countries of very different ideologies. Turkey in WW1 could have sided with the UK, and the US could have sided with Germany. People didn't see Turkey as an Islamic other, but just another power.\n\nI know as an Israeli, you like to wrap your comforting blanket of civilizational bigotry and hatred and mistakenly see Netanyahu as harbringer of a new era. No, he is, but a speed bump to a new world order where alliances are much more transactional and short-lived.  I suggest you read some books about European imperialism in Asia before 1800, which shows a world where Europeans sided with local kingdoms against other Europeans.  This was a world where Europeans adopted native customs and speech.\n\nYou think right-wing nationalism in the West will lead to more support of Israel, but that isn't true. It will just lead to more countries thinking about their national interest first, not on an absurd civilization that Israel is some sort of civilizational vanguard for the West.   Hating Muslims at home doesn't mean you want to kill them abroad.",

The reason people knew it wasn't the IDF is because they'd seen the IDF all the time and know how they look and operate. This is not proof that they knew the IDF is \"morally superior.\" Although I would agree with this guy that IDF robbing stores in West Bank is unheard of as far as I know. If an Arab heard that was happening they would likely say \"hmmm...that sounds odd.\" This doesn't prove that they're super moral, just that this is not the specific crime they generally do. There is not a complete lack of discipline over there. At least in my day, the IDF was quite restrained in the West Bank and generally followed standard military protocols. The settlers were the ones who did the unprovoked violence\n\nI remember seeing a news article about an Australian hitman who was arrested and they found police uniforms from different provinces (states?) in his closet. Can you extrapolate from that something about Australian police brutality? No.",

They may not want to have tea with Netanyahu, but they certainly don’t want to harm or kill people either (as a whole). All my relatives still there have expressed a lack of trust and suspicion towards Israel, but not hate. In fact, that suspicion is grounded mostly towards the US. I’m not sure to what extent the current US govt. has always behaved that way with a “smile”, but at a minimum it is now heavily and openly transactional. They have plenty of evidence, from mosadegh, to Iraq, to Vietnam…. At best the US foreign policy operates like a toddler, at worst it’s extractive and deeply dishonest.",

Hamas is a terrorist organization that commits terrorist acts while also oppressing its own people to stay in power.  \n\nIt's true that various groups throughout history have engaged in terrorism to achieve their goals in their effort for self-determination or to resist oppression. Success of using terrorism to achieve goals is in the single digit percentile. This may make it seem hypocritical about why Israel could get things this way and why Palestinians can't. To put simply, there is a fundamental difference between the actions besides it just being \"terrorism.\"  \n\nMany independence movements started with attacks against those who controlled them and others have pointed out the difference between Hamas being the government in power and the militias being different by nature in both of who they attacked and how they attacked. Times were also different back then as well as the situation. \n\nIt's simply noise when people argue that the Israel and Haganah formed the IDF while absorbing the Lehi and the Irgun. This is a pretty normal occurance. Look at the PLO. Look at how the US Army after the civil war had many former confederate soldiers and officers join. Reintegration of splinter groups and militias is pretty common in countries after a war when they need soldiers. \n\nIn short, anybody making this argument needs to first admit Hamas is a terror organization and their members are terrorists before any discussion can begin on \"but the zionist militias\"",

They were largely self-defensive throughout the British Mandate, and didn’t go on the offensive until the 1947-49 war, and even then only after Jewish Jerusalem had been under siege by Arab forces for months. I don’t agree with all the actions of the Haganah, like the expulsion of Palestinian Arab villagers in parts of the Galilee. But displacement is not the *same thing* as terrorism.\n\nI understand the argument of calling the Irgun and Lehi terrorist orgs at times, or at least saying they committed some terrorist acts. During the Arab Revolt of 1936-1939, there were many Arab attacks on Jewish civilians, which eventually led the Irgun to attack Arab civilians, with attacks like market bombings. Both the Arab attacks and the Zionist Irgun attacks may be seen as terrorism, as they both targeted civilians. Then, of course, there’s the Deir Yassin massacre by the Irgun and Lehi, in which &gt;100 civilians were massacred. Many people will also point to the King David Hotel bombing as evidence Irgun was a terror org, but I feel less strongly about this argument, as I have more sympathy for Arab villagers/civilians than for British police.\n\nIn *any case* though, even if you do believe that some early Zionist militias were terrorists, that *still* doesn’t mean you can’t also call Hamas a terrorist organization too—and on a larger scale. **Oct 7 was 10x the size of the Deir Yassin massacre.**\n\nEven if you think the Irgun and Lehi were terrorists, you can criticize Hamas as a terrorist org too.",

It was an organized militia meant to defend the Jewish civilians of Palestine because it was felt that the British could not protect them against attacks by Arabs. It became the defense organization for Jews in British Mandatory Palestine which was then organized and brought under the centralized control of the mainstream (Labor/Mapai) Zionists by David Ben-Gurion.\n\nEvery time this topic of early Zionism in British Mandatory Palestine comes up, the constant refrain from the anti-Israel side is: Jabotinsky, Irgun, Lehi. It's never the Haganah and David Ben-Gurion – and if they are brought up it's always an attempt to find the most nefarious and/or out of context statement or incident.

The actions they took were hugely important and fundamentally shifted the political terrain in Palestine in the final years of the mandate. I don't think it's unreasonable to argue that they were the reasons why the British ultimately left Palestine. And beyond that, there's a reasonable case to be made that there wouldn't have been a civil war in 1947/1948 were it not for the Irgun and Lehi (although counterfactuals like this are very difficult to prove, of course). So, yeah - the Irgun and Lehi were important.\n\nThe second reason is that Begin (Irgun commander) and Shamir (Lehi commander) dominated Israeli politics from 1977 - 1992; which were hugely important years in cementing Israeli control over the West Bank. Their political party, Likud, has essentially dominated Israeli politics since 1977 with only a few short breaks. Meanwhile, Ben-Gurion's political party currently holds a grant total of *four* seats in the Knesset. So it's not unreasonable to look at the Irgun and Lehi as the predecessors to the contemporary political leadership of Israel.\n\n&gt; It's never the Haganah and David Ben-Gurion – and if they are brought up it's always an attempt to find the most nefarious and/or out of context statement or incident.\n\nYou're right though, pro-Palestinians *should* bring up the Haganah and Ben-Gurion more since Ben-Gurion was ultimately the architect of the Nakba. And the mass expulsion of Palestinians was mostly conducted by the Haganah operating on his orders.",

They played both sides with this. The Jewish Agency publicly condemned the Irgun's attack on the Haifa Oil Refinery, but also authorized an attack on the village of Balad al-Shaykh the day afterwards as \"revenge\" for the Jews who were killed after the explosions went off.

They can only be portrayed as passive actors helplessly bobbing on the tides of history, unable to take any action to positively affect their own situation.” \nAbdul Rahman Hassan Azzam, the Secretary-General of the Arab League, had declared in 1947 that, were a war to take place with the proposed establishment of a Jewish state, it would lead to \"a war of extermination and momentous massacre which will be spoken of like the Mongolian massacre and the Crusades.” Jamal Husseini, the Mufti’s brother, represented the Arab Higher Committee at the UN. He told the Security Council in April 1948 “of course the Arabs started the fighting. We told the whole world we were going to fight.” (Thus ensuring that Azzam would get the war whose consequences he anticipated)\n\nMore from Azzam: \n\n“The Arab world is not in a compromising mood. It’s likely, Mr. Horowitz, that your plan is rational and logical, but the fate of nations is not decided by rational logic. Nations never concede; they fight. You won’t get anything by peaceful means or compromise. You can, perhaps, get something, but only by the force of arms. We shall try to defeat you. I’m not sure we’ll succeed, but we’ll try. We were able to drive out the Crusaders, but on the other hand we lost Spain and Persia. It may be that we shall lose Palestine. But it’s too late to talk of peaceful solutions.” September 1947, cited in https://israeled.org/abdulrahman-azzam-pasha-rejects-compromise-zionists/\n\n\nHere’s another quote from August 1947--before the UN even voted on the Partition plan-- from  Fawaz al-Quwuqji, whose \"Arab Liberation Army\" subsequently invaded the British Mandate in the spring of 1948:“we will have to initiate total war. We will murder, wreck and ruin everything standing in our way, be it English, American or Jewish\". Had the Arabs accepted the first ever Palestinian state, there would have been no refugees.\n\nThe response to this is usually a justification of the Arab decision to resort to war, with simultaneous insistence that they were still nonetheless passive and without agency.  And then we get to the actual grievance that they genuinely didn’t have control over: *they didn’t want the Jews coming back to their indigenous homeland.* That is what they acted upon, and almost every choice their leaders have made has been for the worse. (Not that every choice Israeli leaders made was perfect; far from it.). But let’s give up the fiction that Arabs were just sitting around minding their own business when suddenly the Jews came in and drove them off.",

I would say most people generally accept the idea that when a state actor commits an act of violence it is legitimate, whereas when a non-state actor commits a similar act of violence it is not legitimate (and is terrorism, instead).\n\nThis is \"value neutral\" in the sense that we might look at some non-state actors as heroic (freedom fighters?) and some state actors as evil or visa-versa.\n\nIt's worth saying that the line between \"state\" and \"non-state\" actors is often extremely thin. The Haganah was a non-state actor until May 15th, 1948 and then it suddenly became a state actor (called the IDF, of course). They were not the first terrorist organization to make the leap into being a legitimate state actor, nor were they the last.\n\n&gt; The underlying problem with the “both sides did it” approach is that it conflates historical context with contemporary morality. Criticizing Hamas today is about actions in the present, not the imperfect past of another group. History informs ethics, but it doesn’t provide carte blanche to excuse ongoing acts of violence. \n\nI generally agree with you on this. I do have one quibble here though.\n\nTo me one of the most disturbing things I see is the rhetoric of pro-Israel supporters who claim that Hamas are \"animals.\" Or that Palestinians don't love their children because Hamas sometimes stores weapons underneath schools. \n\nThe irony is not lost on me that the Haganah *also* stored weapons in schools and yet for whatever reasons pro-Israel people don't think that *they* didn't love their children. Both the Irgun and the Haganah committed horrible atrocities against Palestinian Arab civilians, but Israel has named streets after their leaders -- they aren't regarded as \"non-human animals.\" And so on and so forth.\n\nSo yes, previous acts of terrorism *do not ever justify* future acts of terrorism. But understanding the context can help humanize people. You don't have to *like* Hamas, but you certainly need to recognize that the people who do are in fact humans, just like Israelis.",

That alone breaks the symmetry. Hamas fires from these locations. Not “stores and leaves,” not “moves weapons elsewhere to fight.”\nRockets are launched from schoolyards, command centers operate inside hospitals, tunnels run under classrooms.\n\nThat is operational use, not concealment.\n\nThe British hypothetical is fiction\n\nIf the British blew up a school in 1946 it would be because weapons were found there, not because attacks were launched from there while children were present. There is no evidence of the Haganah systematically fighting from schools with civilians inside.\n\nSo no, this isn’t “irony.” It’s a false equivalence built on a hypothetical instead of evidence.\n\nNow, second claim. Yes, Haganah committed atrocities. But saying “they committed atrocities” is not the same as saying “civilian harm was doctrine.”Tohar HaNeshek existed as a norm, not as a guarantee. Violations of restraint were debated internally, sometimes condemned, often justified as exceptional or retaliatory.\n\nThat already distinguishes it from Hamas, where attacks on civilians are celebrated, not apologized for, killing civilians is framed as religious duty. There is no concept of “violation.” It is the mission.\n\nIf a rule is broken, the rule still exists. If there is no rule, nothing is broken.\n\nThat distinction matters morally and legally.\n\nOne massacre does not define doctrine. If it did, every army on Earth would be defined solely by its worst day. The Haganah did not adopt a policy of massacring villages as a standing strategy. \n\nHamas does adopt civilian targeting as a standing strategy.",

I agree that context matters but I want to challenge the underlying premise in which you are framing that message. \n\n1)If context matters when analyzing the Israeli nationalist militias of the 1940s then context matters when analyzing the actions of Hamas or any other group. What I find in Pro Israel discourse is that they are very quick to contextualize the actions of Israel or it's political precursors which include the Israeli nationalist militias of the 40s, but they will turn around and take a very acontextual, manichaean approach to Hamas or Palestinian militant groups. The Israeli nationalist militias saw themselves as fighting a British occupation force in the 40s. And Palestinian militant groups see themselves as fighting an Israeli occupation force. Even Shulamit Aloni a former Cabinet minister in Yitzhak Rabin in her interview on Democracy Now noted parallels between the two. \n\n2)When you say that liberation, terrorism, and legitimacy aren't black and white, yes. That's true. And supporters of Palestinian militant groups make the exact same arguments when it comes to their cause as well. \n\nThe reality is this. The killing of civilians as a tactic should be condemned across the board. I don't care which group is doing it or what cause they are fighting for. However we also need to have consistent, intellectually honest standards. Which is something that many people don't apply.",

I would classify them both as terrorist groups, because they both murdered civilians for their cause, and that’s disgusting. \n\nIt makes no sense to me, though, to bring up Irgun in today’s conversation. Correct me if I’m wrong, but wasn’t Irgun only around for a short time? And they dissolved once there was a political resolution, even though they didn’t get everything they were hoping for. Some Irgun tactics were probably absorbed into the modern day IDF as policy, but not terrorizing tactics.\n\nHamas has been around for decades, and there have been several opportunities for political resolution which they and Arab countries have refused to accept. Hamas starts wars, but they don’t own the consequences of their actions. It seems insane to me that they keep doing the same thing expecting different outcomes. \n\nFor decades, they have been terrorizing Israel with support from Arab countries and UNRWA, who have their own motivations for keeping Palestinians in an oppressed state. The way I see it, Palestinians have no agency not because of Israel, but because Arab nations are using them as pawns and frankly don’t care about them as humans. \n\nPalestinians have been indoctrinated to see themselves as eternal victims. As a result, Hamas and annihilation of the Jews looks like their only option. But Palestinians are fighting the wrong people. Hamas are not resistance fighters, they are state-sponsored terrorists.",

And a continued denial of their right to live in the land they have ties to.\n\nRe:2. I fundamentally disagree with your framing. All the way from the second Aliyah in 1904-14, Palestinians were aware that some nation building was taking place. Hence the prominent Christian Arab anti-Zionist publications Falastin and Al-Karmil in 1910s. Furthermore, the Hassan McMahon correspondence of 1915-16 and the Balfour declaration of 1917 upset many Palestinians. Add to that land purchases from absentee landlords, Jewish-only labor in settlements and you have a recipe for resentment.  It is in this context that some Palestinians resorted to violent protests in 1920s. I do not excuse any attacks on civilians, and I readily condemn any such acts. My criticism is in the *systemic*, *premeditated* violence perpetrated by Irgun, Haganah, Stern militias under the comicity of the Jewish Executive on a scale that left 750,000 Palestinians homeless and stateless.\n\nAny argument that justifies vilification of a whole people and excuses their suffering is calling for collective punishment, which is inherently reprehensible.

So it wasn't really a paragon of self-determination. It was hobbled when the US representative recommended peacekeeping operations instead of enforcing the partition plan in Feb '48. Even before the British withdrawal, the Zionist Paramilitaries had started cleansing operations. For example, Plan Dalet was finalized in March of 1948. The Arab coalition, vastly outnumbered by the Zionists, only entered Palestine after the declaration of Independence.\n\nI didnt say any of that in your second paragraph.",

The Arab Muslims and Turks horrifically mistreated the Jews in their midst for countless centuries BEFORE Zionism\n\nTheir is a very common misconception that comes up when we talk about this subject.

But I feel like I need to talk about this because the pro-Palestine / anti-semites keep bringing this up... This is why I am talking about it.

In the Arab and Turkish worlds, your ethnic background is considered to come from your father...\n\nSo let's, with a VERY simple example, see how this would play out. The Ottoman Turks preferred European wives. In the culture of the Oghuz Turks this was a non-issue. The ethnicity of the child was considered that of the father...\n\nSo let's look at this and make some VERY simple examples. It is the 11th century. An Oghuz Turkish man, looks and is ethnically 100% Asian and looks Asian... He has a child with a European woman. According to Ottoman and Arab culture, the child is 100% Oghuz Turk and is a full member of this tribe and is culturally a member of this group.\n\nBut GENETICALLY he is ONLY 50% Turkish. He is 50% Turkish and say, 50% Albanian or 50% Italian or whatever. So the son has some other leading position in the tribe or has some important position in the empire. Because the Ottomans PREFERRED European wives, HE gets a European wife, a woman who converted to Islam from say, the Caucuses or wherever. They have a child. Culturally the child is ALSO 100% Oghuz Turkish. But his DNA is NOW 75% European... you get it? Culture is not the same as DNA...",

Ancient Hebrew has a lot of divergences, and they're pretty systemic in what those changes are.\n\n2: This is the key sticking point, and why Hebrew hasn't changed nearly as much as, say, English has: It's been essentially a dead language for two millennia. The Jewish diaspora used it for liturgy, but that was about it.\n\nWhat you see in modern Israel is revivalists resurrecting a dead language. But if you're considering this as being in a state of succession to ancient Israel, you may consider whether if modern Italians suddenly decided to switch the national language to Latin, if that would make them Romans.\n\nAs for why Arabic is spoken in the region now, it hardly bears mention; they were conquered, of course, and the language of the conquerors became a good language to know.

    "body": "\\&gt; since the Israeli claim rests on them being the true heirs of the Canaanites\n\nNot sure where you get that idea from. The \"claim\" is really just that Jews needed a place to be safe given all of the pogroms (and then the Holocaust of course) in Europe, and that obviously would make sense to be in the land that they were forcibly removed from. Given the state of empires and the operating order of the world at the time of Herzl, it's not so crazy that buying land there would be seen as the moral and most practical approach. Now, it's not exactly fair to say that it was able to be sold in the first place given that the Palestinians were dominated by imperial power, but that's a modern day view and is not particularly applicable to the time period that Jews started buying land there.\n\nThe practicality, however, of effectively crowding out a place with a million people already, and establishing a Jewish state in Muslim-conquered land and thinking it will go well, would probably have given me pause if I were Jews in the early 1900s. Following the Holocaust, though, and that the plan was already well in progress and Britain had the mandate to do something about it, I don't think any people would do anything differently than trying to establish some kind of state there. I think people severely underplay just how much the Cold War made it so that it would turn into a constant proxy conflict, rather than there potentially being a viable future for some kind of binational South Africa-style state. I don't think the Arabs ever would have gone along with it anyway, but I think it would have been much more justifiable, and \\*maybe\\* workable. The two-state solution, though, is, and has always been, a joke.",

They had to deal with a bad economy. You mention terrorism from Pakistan. Have you noticed that there aren't open borders between Pakistan and India? That is in part because that prevents Pakastani terrorists from being able to simply walk into Mumbai and kill people. Israelis do not want Palestinians to walk into Tel Aviv and kill people either.\n\nThe reality is, the solution is for the war to end. Until then, peacetime campaigns like \"free movement between Israel and Palestine\" and \"more startups in Palestine\" or whatever are meaningless. Israel is not going to sacrifice the lives of its own citizens so that Palestinians can have better jobs. Why do you think the checkpoints went up in the first place? Palestinians were stabbing and bombing Israeli civilians, and metal detectors stopped that.\n\nThe reason the war is going on for so long is that the Palestinian goal is to wipe out Israel. Palestinians have to give up that goal to have peace. Not just some of them — the majority of them. They have to start wiping out their own leaders who insist on fighting an endless war to achieve that goal.\n\nOR and possibly more realistically, the larger Muslims world needs to accept that Israel exists and isn't going anywhere, and stop using Palestinians as a pawn to help soothe their humiliation that Jews have a country. They need to offer Palestinians citizenship in their own countries so their constant refugee status can come to an end. They need to make some agreement with Israel to work on the details about how the rest of it will all work for the Palestinians who want to stay in the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nAfter the war ends, the other details can be worked out — economic opportunities and what not.",

Deaths from settler violence are much less prominent than crime in the WB or terror attacks against Jews. So according to you they are \"rare\".\n\nSecondly, I would like to point out that the outcry towards the economic situation is sincere. However, it is not limited to the IL/PS conflict or because of it. The difference between the have and have not is not only due to conflicts. You can look at Africa for example, a lot of problems don't trace back to only wars. Israelis' economic success is not at the expense of Palestinians' ones, and the majority of Israel's exports are services. Of course you can still point out that Israel's security measures come at the expense of Palestinians' daily lives. But it doesn't affect the services (or digital) sector as it does manual labour. Both Israel and the Palestinian territories will never be physical exports powerhouses.\n\nNow what can you do? You as an individual maybe can support projects like Rawabi which help reach economic independence. However, in the long run it is not something that depends on individuals and more on the leadership of the Palestinians.",

But this cannot fully justify crippling millions of civilians. Statistically, terror attacks in Israel are relatively rare—comparable to rates of violent crime in developed countries—yet the collective restrictions placed on Palestinians vastly exceed the actual threat.\n\nTo say that Hamas “complicates governance” is an understatement. It’s a radical Muslim group which seeks to destroy Israel and make all of the land Muslim. The fact that the Israeli policy was to let them even exist as a neighbor and continue attacking for years, shows the mercy of Zionism. To let the Gazan regime exist at all, even under blockade, required a lot of restraint. Others wouldn’t even want such a neighbor at all and would have wiped them out by now. \n\n&gt;The economic and social disparity is heart-wrenching.\n\nWhat about Egyptians? Or Jordanians? They also have disparity with Israel. Israel is far above them. But why? There’s no occupation or blockade there. \n\nIt’s not like the Middle East is a thriving region and Israel is just bringing the Palestinians down. The region in general, is pretty bad, and Israel is the exception. So when you see lack of development in Palestine, that’s just the norm for that sort of people.

It's important to contextualize all this properly otherwise it's impossible to understand this.\n\nThe vast majority of Arabs in the region have, for nearly a century, maintained the position that they oppose ANY self determination of Jews on any part of their indigenous land. This is not a conflict based on borders. Arabs have maintained an ideological position informed by Islam, and more recently by Nazi ideology that persista in the Arab world. There is a reason why my Iraqi Jewish family was offered compensation by post-war Germany. The Nazis were VERY active in the region, the Palestinian/Arab leadership were their buddies. Just to setup the situation.\n\nJews are a small ethnic minority in the region surrounded by very large, powerful neighbors that have tried to destroy them multiple times to create their own Arab-dominated ethnostates. That is the status quo of the region.\n\nPalestinians today are brazen because these forces (Arab neighbors) will support them until the last Palestinian breathes. When your neighbor has the position \"either you die, or we die trying\", the conversation basically ends. \n\nWhat about the Israeli side? Surely the same rhetoric exists? Israeli leadership has swung between \"we must offer land for peace like we did with Egypt\" to \"we will do nothing. Offer nothing, and not impede settlers, until we have a partner on the other side willing to talk\". \n\nMeanwhile, Palestinian leadership has left their people with nothing. Arafat, who is considered to be one of Palestines greatest heroes, died a multibillionaire and left his people with nothing. Hamas leaders get fat in Qatar, and Fatah are making bank off the status quo. Even if Israel tried to go out of its way to give Palestinians land of their own, there isn't even a partner to negotiate with. If you care about Palestinians, start with fostering their leadership.",

Here are the restrictions \n\n1) Israelis don’t like the Palestinians at all, generally don’t see them as human, are ideologically opposed to a 2SS at this point, and so is the Israeli government\n\n2) Palestine agrees to disarmament and follows through with it\n\n3) Israel and its citizens believes international law is a lie and that listening to the international community is a mistake\n\n4) Israel wants ownership of Judea and Sumaria and does not respect Palestine’s borders much as is\n\n5) Israel will have not just superiority over Palestine militarily, but Palestine will have no method to stop Israel from enacting any military action except at minuscule cost to Israel if that.\n\nGiven these circumstances, then if Palestine agrees to this deal faithfully, then does Israel go to war again to reap the benefits, and if the answer is yes as a hypothetical, then why would Palestine agree to this in the first place? It would be suicide",

Israel is not interested in paying reparations to Arabs since Arabs disposseed Jews too and they aren't paying any reparations. Whining about victimhood even though you did exactly the same to the people you are whining about does not entitle you to reparations from them.",

Gaza is almost pacified so give it another year maybe and they'll be completely disarmed. Send in the wheel excavators and they could have the ground scrubbed of unexploded munitions and tunnels in less than another year. Start with a nice flat clean slate and some nice new tents, eliminate the antagonists like the UN and hamas and Gaza, in a generation or so might be ready for an easing of restrictions, who knows, I guess it depends on them if they want to live in peace or not. \n\nGiving up the settlements isn't going to happen, again nothing in it for Israel. Asking Israel to pay reparations is nuts, they didn't start it, speaking of which, the Israeli's are still owed reparations from when they were thrown out of all those Arab nations, and particularly in the West Bank by Jordan and in the Old Trans-Jordon. In the end reparations work out more in favor of Israel than the Arabs in the mandate area. Again, nothing in it for Israel. \n\nMy two cents is that plan would never work. I think a better plan would be for Gaza to voluntarily disarm immediately and peacefully evacuate all areas behind the yellow line as penance for the atrocities of 10/7. Surrender all hamas members to the Israeli army within 30 days or face consequences. \n\nThe West Bank is a whole other can of worms. \n\nAnyway its great that folks are trying to come up with solutions but its got to be equitable and it must take into consideration that Israel has been forced to defend itself from day one and has no reason to lift restrictions. Trust is something you gain over time and so far its been one terrorist act after another so, Israel has no incentive to lift restrictions. \n\nMy two cents   \nCheers.",

So might as well deal with it all at once and dig up the tunnels while your at it.  \nHere's my plan\n\nI'm sure the plan could be improved but the nuts and bolts are there.\n\nIsrael should take the coastline in Gaza, its a huge smuggling risk and if the Gazan's aren't going to willingly disarm then its a must. Say a one mile buffer zone between the water and the Arabs. Two would be better. Extend the Yellow line to the Wadi Gaza and take the coast along the entire strip. That'd pin hamas in a manageable area with no chance of importing any more weapons.\n\nThe order of operations should be something like.\n\n1. Evacuate all civilians south of the Wadi Gaza but within the current yellow line to the north.\n2. Wheel excavators sift and flatten the area within the yellow line south of the Wadi Gaza down to a depth of about 50 meters.\n3. evacuate all civilians north of the Wadi Gaza back to the south and within the existing yellow line except for a new buffer zone along the coast one mile deep.\n4. The new yellow line is moved forward to the Wadi Gaza taking an additional 25% or so of Gaza in reparations for failing to disarm and the atrocities of 10/7.\n5. wheel excavators flatten the area north of the Wadi Gaza.\n6. wheel excavators move on to flatten the remaining areas controlled by Israel behind the yellow line.\n\nResult.  \n7) All of Gaza is now cleared of unexploded munitions and buildings intact or otherwise, all rubble has been removed for recycling and use outside of Gaza. No salvageable building materials should be left within Gaza. Gaza is flat as a pancake ready to rebuild when conditions are met.  \n8) Hamas is now contained in an area of about 30 square miles of flat gravel sifted of any and all building materials and tunnels down to a depth of about 50 meters.  \n9) set up a 28 square mile refugee tent city and a 2 square mile POW camp.  \n10) Review and register all as they come to the aid stations within the new camp and place them accordingly.  \n11) Aid stations and resources should be controlled and operated by the IDF and all recipients certified as legit refugees.  \n12) The cost of clearing Gaza and operating the refugee camp should come out of the Gaza reconstruction fund or UN funds with the IDF being compensated for its participation. No NGOs should be allowed to participate.  \n13) POW camps should be run and funded in accordance with the Geneva Conventions  \n14) No reconstruction should begin until a period of ten years has passed without incident.\n\nIn the end you've created a legit refugee camp devoid of combatants and antagonistic influences and segregated the belligerents in the accordance with the Geneva conventions. Let the peace process begin. In a decade or so, reconstruction could begin as long as the refugees remain peaceful and build some trust with their Israeli neighbors first. \n\nThe problem thus far is that the UN refused to segregate combatants from non combatants and instead, actively supported their employ within the UN, thus subverting the entire goal of peace between the two parties.\n\nIsrael will need to start over with a clean slate in order to re educate the civilian population while incarcerating the radicals in the POW camp. POWs will need to remain incarcerated until deportations arrangements can be made.\n\nEmigration by the refugees should be immediately allowed to anywhere outside of the mandate area.\n\nThe solution is simple, confine the problem to a smaller and smaller areas and limit the risks through proper preparation of the site, which in this case means flattening all of Gaza. Those huge wheel excavators could handle it in no time. Less than a year depending on how many you have. I'd. say a half dozen of the Bagger wheel excavators would do the job in less than a year.\n\nCheers",

There is no need to relocate all of them. That's an unreasonable ask.\n\nWhat is more, besides E Jerusalem, all of the West Bank remains unannexed. So your distinction between \"unannexed\" and \"annexed\" doesn't make sense.\n\nAdditionally, the Israeli concern with Palestinian statehood now in the West Bank is that such a state without Israeli military presence may be used as a launch pad for attacks against Israel, like South Lebanon and Gaza were used. However, the West Bank is on Jerusalem's municipal border and just a few km from Tel Aviv and Ben Gurion airport, on higher ground. This plan does not address this security risk at all. There are no security guarantees. You demand that Palestine \"demilitarize\", but without the IDF there to ensure that, who is there to enforce it?\n\nNor are there any institutional demands on the Palestinians for statehood. The Palestinian national movement for a century has spent very little of its effort developing effective institutions for statehood. There are no requirements for Palestinians to develop effective state institutions. The current PA is weak and ineffective, and institutions are weak. Without strong state institutions, the Palestinian state is likely to devolve into conflict, which will inevitably used as an excuse to attack Israel, unless this piece is taken seriously.\n\nFinally, there is no demand of Palestinians to give up ideology of opposition to Israel and annihilation of the Jewish state. So long as that is the national ideology of Palestine, the result will be the same. This ideology is not \"radical\" in Palestinian society, but mainstream. Without a plan to deradicalize and actually have Palestinian society accept that Jews are not foreigners and Israel but belong there, and have a right to self determination, then we haven't moved an inch.",

Note the date. If he could see what it has become he would be rolling over in his grave.      \n\nDec 2, 1948      \nTO THE EDITORS OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:         \n\nAmong the most disturbing political phenomena of our times is the emergence in the newly created state of Israel of the “Freedom Party” (Tnuat Haherut), a political party closely akin in its organization, methods, political philosophy and social appeal to the NotSee and Fascist parties. It was formed out of the membership and following of the former Irgun Zvai Leumi, a terrorist, right-wing, chauvinist organization in Palestine.       \n\nThe current visit of Menachem Begin, leader of this party, to the United States is obviously calculated to give the impression of American support for his party in the coming Israeli elections, and to cement political ties with conservative Zionist elements in the United States. Several Americans of national repute have lent their names to welcome his visit. It is inconceivable that those who oppose fascism throughout the world, if correctly informed as to Mr. Begin’s political record and perspectives, could add their names and support to the movement he represents.        \n\nBefore irreparable damage is done by way of financial contributions, public manifestations in Begin’s behalf, and the creation in Palestine of the impression that a large segment of America supports Fascist elements in Israel, the American public must be informed as to the record and objectives of Mr. Begin and his movement.         \n\nThe public avowals of Begin’s party are no guide whatever to its actual character. Today they speak of freedom, democracy and anti-imperialism, whereas until recently they openly preached the doctrine of the Fascist state. It is in its actions that the terrorist party betrays its real character; from its past actions we can judge what it may be expected to do in the future.       \n\nAttack on Arab Village      \n\nA shocking example was their behavior in the Arab village of Deir Yassin. This village, off the main roads and surrounded by Jewish lands, had taken no part in the war, and had even fought off Arab bands who wanted to use the village as their base. On April 9 (THE NEW YORK TIMES), terrorist bands attacked this peaceful village, which was not a military objective in the fighting, killed most of its inhabitants “240 men, women, and children” and kept a few of them alive to parade as captives through the streets of Jerusalem. Most of the Jewish community was horrified at the deed, and the Jewish Agency sent a telegram of apology to King Abdullah of Trans-Jordan. But the terrorists, far from being ashamed of their act, were proud of this massacre, publicized it widely, and invited all the foreign correspondents present in the country to view the heaped corpses and the general havoc at Deir Yassin.       \n\nThe Deir Yassin incident exemplifies the character and actions of the Freedom Party.       \n\nWithin the Jewish community they have preached an admixture of ultranationalism, religious mysticism, and racial superiority. Like other Fascist parties they have been used to break strikes, and have themselves pressed for the destruction of free trade unions. In their stead they have proposed corporate unions on the Italian Fascist model.      \n\nDuring the last years of sporadic anti-British violence, the IZL and Stern groups inaugurated a reign of terror in the Palestine Jewish community. Teachers were beaten up for speaking against them, adults were shot for not letting their children join them. By gangster methods, beatings, window-smashing, and wide-spread robberies, the terrorists intimidated the population and exacted a heavy tribute.      \n\nThe people of the Freedom Party have had no part in the constructive achievements in Palestine. They have reclaimed no land, built no settlements, and only detracted from the Jewish defense activity. Their much-publicized immigration endeavors were minute, and devoted mainly to bringing in Fascist compatriots.      \n\nDiscrepancies Seen      \n\nThe discrepancies between the bold claims now being made by Begin and his party, and their record of past performance in Palestine bear the imprint of no ordinary political party. This is the unmistakable stamp of a Fascist party for whom terrorism (against Jews, Arabs, and British alike), and misrepresentation are means, and a “Leader State” is the goal.      \n\nIn the light of the foregoing considerations, it is imperative that the truth about Mr. Begin and his movement be made known in this country. It is all the more tragic that the top leadership of American Zionism has refused to campaign against Begin’s efforts, or even to expose to its own constituents the dangers to Israel from support to Begin.     \n\nThe undersigned therefore take this means of publicly presenting a few salient facts concerning Begin and his party; and of urging all concerned not to support this latest manifestation of fascism.       \n\n(signed)\n\nISIDORE ABRAMOWITZ, HANNAH ARENDT, ABRAHAM BRICK, RABBI JESSURUN CARDOZO, ALBERT EINSTEIN, HERMAN EISEN, M.D., HAYIM FINEMAN, M.

    "body": "Thanks for this. This made me read about Einsteins views. Indeed, Einstein was a Labor Zionist (as opposed to a Revisionist). Until 1947, he opppsed the idea of a Jewish state. His views changed in the letter to Nehru as you quoted.\n\nHe said in a 1938 speech:\n\n&gt; I should much rather see reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of living together in peace than the creation of a Jewish state. My awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists the idea of a Jewish state with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power, no matter how modest. I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustain—especially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our own ranks, against which we have already had to fight strongly, even without a Jewish state. ... If external necessity should after all compel us to assume this burden, let us bear it with tact and patience.\n\nAfter independence, he supported Israel but was critical of the violence that was inflicted to achieve it. (That's a sensible take).\n\n---\n\nEinstein's discourse on Zionism is as a means to right the wrongs done to Jews in Europe and to demand their own homeland as others had. I think it notably lacks mention of the injustices that were to be done and later done to the Palestinians. That's important because those injustices, known globally in retrospect, are the core of the Palestinian issue.\n\nHis statements are not egregious or unexpected. He was neither a decision-maker in the World Zionist Congress / Jewish Agency in Palestine, nor on the ground in Palestine to see the events unfold. He just wanted justice for his people.",

However, they have never stated to conquer the entire Middle East, or Palestine.\n\nThere are many issues with your post but this conclusion you came to is just flat out false, since you brought up Ben Gurion for instance:\n\n\"Does the establishment of a Jewish state \\[in only part of Palestine\\] advance or retard the conversion of this country into a Jewish country? My assumption (which is why I am a fervent proponent of a state, even though it is now linked to partition) is that a Jewish state on only part of the land is not the end but the beginning. This is because this increase in possession is of consequence not only in itself, but because through it we increase our strength, and **every increase in strength helps in the possession of the land as a whole.** The establishment of a state, even if only on a portion of the land, is the maximal reinforcement of our strength at the present time and a powerful boost to our historical endeavors to liberate the entire country.\" \\[9\\]  \n([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937\\_Ben-Gurion\\_letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937_Ben-Gurion_letter))\n\nYou go over a portion of this letter in your post so it's strange you didn't actually examine it in its totality, as you were complaining about others not doing.\n\n...\n\n\"Weizmann and Ben-Gurion pressed for a solution based on partition. Said Weizmann: 'The Jews would be fools not to accept it, even if \\[the land they were allocated\\] were the size of a table cloth.' Both saw partition as a stepping stone to further expansion and the eventual takeover of the whole of Palestine. **'No Zionist can forgo the smallest portion of the Land of Israel,'** Ben-Gurion was quoted as saying.\"  \n([https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr\\_0/page/138/mode/2up?q=stepping+stone](https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr_0/page/138/mode/2up?q=stepping+stone))\n\n...\n\n\"It might be noted that the “boundaries of Zionist aspirations” in Ben Gurion’s “vision” were quite broad, including southern Lebanon, southern Syria, today’s Jordan, all of cis-Jordan, and the Sinai. This was, in fact, one of Ben-Gurion’s constant themes. In internal discussion in 1938, he stated that **“after we become a strong force, as the result of the creation of a state, we shall abolish partition and expand to the whole of Palestine. The state will only be a stage in the realization of Zionism and its task is to prepare the ground for our expansion into the whole of Palestine by a Jewish-Arab agreement. The state will have to preserve order not only by preaching morality but by machine guns, if necessary.”**\n\nThe “agreement” that Ben-Gurion had in mind was to be with King Abdullah of Jordan, who would be induced to cede areas of cis-Jordan under his control, while many of the Arab residents would leave. Earlier, **Ben-Gurion had explained to Arab interlocutors that “our land” included Transjordan, and that it extended from the Sinai to “the source of the Jordan.”** In internal discussion he urged that “we do not suggest now to announce the final aim,” which is “far-reaching,” even more so than the aim of those who were opposing partition. “I am unwilling to abandon the great Jewish vision, the final vision,” he added. This vision, here unspecified in scale, “is an organic, spiritual and ideological component of my Jewishness and my Zionist aspiration,” Ben-Gurion explained.\"  \n([https://archive.org/details/NoamChomskyFatefulTriangleF/page/n287/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/NoamChomskyFatefulTriangleF/page/n287/mode/2up))\n\n...\n\n\"Although the Jewish Agency accepted the partition plan, it did not accept the proposed borders as final and Israel's declaration of independence avoided the mention of any boundaries. A state in part of Palestine was seen as a stage towards a larger state when opportunity allowed. Although the borders were “bad from a military and political point of view,” **Ben Gurion urged fellow Jews to accept the UN Partition Plan, pointing out that arrangements are never final, “not with regard to the regime, not with regard to borders, and not with regard to international agreements.”**\n\nThe idea of partition being a temporary expedient dated back to the Peel Partition proposal of 1937. When the Zionist Congress had rejected partition on the grounds that the Jews had an inalienable right to settle anywhere in Palestine, **Ben Gurion had argued in favour of acceptance: “I see in the realisation of this plan practically the decisive stage in the beginning of full redemption and the most wonderful lever for the gradual conquest of all of Palestine.”**  \n([https://archive.org/details/palestineisraelu0000mcdo/mode/2up?q=full+redemption](https://archive.org/details/palestineisraelu0000mcdo/mode/2up?q=full+redemption))\n\n“After the formation of a large army in the wake of the establishment of the state, we will abolish partition and expand to the whole of Palestine.”  \n— Ben Gurion, p. 22, *The Birth of Israel* (1987), Simha Flapan.\n\n“If it was permissible to move an Arab from the Galilee to Judea, why it is impossible to move an Arab from Hebron to Transjordan, which is much closer? There are vast expanses of land there and we are overcrowded. Even the High Commission agrees to a transfer to Transjordan if we equip the peasants with land and money. If the Peel Commission and the London Government accept, we’ll remove the land problem from the agenda.”",

Eventually he realized that they ought to be resettled in Transjordan.\n\nIn any case, OP's claim that Zionist leaders or Ben Gurion specifically, did not want to conquer the entirety of Palestine is wrong .

He also says later in his testimony:\n\nThis is a very misleading reading of Ben Gurion's testimony. Yes, he was not in favor of a bi-national state. But that doesn't mean partition was his favored solution. What he wanted was to establish some sort of trusteeship over the territory, which would allow for large scale Jewish immigration, before establishing a Jewish state in the entirety of Palestine. This was necessary because a democracy could not be established without a Jewish majority.\n\n&gt;CHAIRMAN: On the other hand, we see that you want the abolition of the Mandate and you do not want the substitution of a trusteeship, or something of that kind, for the Mandate. Then the question must come up: how do you think that immigration could be implemented if the Mandate has ceased? What kind of government do you think should be established in this country instead of the Mandate?\n\n&gt;Mr. BEN GURION: Well, that is a very legitimate question, and a very sensible question, and I will try to answer you to the best of my ability. We say that the White Paper policy is illegal, and therefore, it should be removed at once. The Mandate, in fact, does not exist because it was violated by the Mandatory. We are not in favour of renewing it. We do not believe that in the future it will be carried out better than in the past. Therefore, we say that the original intention and the need, and what in our conviction is just, should be decided upon by the United Nations, and a Jewish State should be established.\n\n&gt;There are two parts in the establishment of a state: one is the material part, which is the most essential; the other is the legal part, the purely formal one, which is also of great importance.\n\n&gt;I will say a word about the material establishment, because the whole difficulty of the problem here is that you have a people, you have a country, and their right to the country was acknowledged, but the people do not happen to be there yet. They were dispossessed, and they have to come back. So, the first thing is the material establishment of the state, which means that plans based on our experience and on achievements, examined and approved by experts-economic, irrigation, agricultural, industrial experts, and so on-should be examined by the Committee and the United Nations to see how they can be carried out; and that a million Jews should be resettled in their country.\n\n&gt;In our view it is not only possible, but it is possible to do so by good will. It is possible to do it in a very short time. This is the material establishment of a national home for the Jewish State. This may take some time. In the meantime, it will be supervised by the highest authority of the United Nations. The fact that the Mandatory itself referred it to the United Nations implies a certain recognition that this is the place where it has to be judged and de, decided, although the Mandatory did not undertake formally to carry it out. But there is an indication that this is the place where it should be decided.\n\n&gt;Assuming that on the recommendations of your Committee the United Nations approves of that plan, the material establishment, it means the settlement of the first million Jews I say a million, it may be 900,000 or it may be 1,100,000, to state a round figure-in the shortest possible time. Even the shortest possible time may and must take some time. I am unable to say how long it will take. I think no one is able to say that, because there are always in human affairs unforeseen things which may happen. But it should not take longer, as far as w.e can judge now-it must not take longer than a few years. Not necessarily longer than a few years. Then, in the meantime, a committee, or any instrument which the United Nations will decide on, will supervise.\n\nQuotes continued in comment below",

When the United Nations will see that the main purpose for which, this country is destined, to solve the Jewish problem, that the main thing has been done and that the time is ripe to undertake administration of the Government itself, then the second phase, the legal, the formal establishment of a state will be reached. **Whether it will take two years or three years, I cannot say, but in that transition period it will be in charge of the United Nations. That is all we envisage here.**  \n  \n  \nCHAIRMAN: Let us assume that there would be violent resistance to enforcing the immigration, would you mean, in any circumstances, to go on and fight down the resistance?\n\n&gt;Mr. BEN GURION: I said we do not ask for a Mandate any more, so it is not a question. The question does not arise on the Mandate. But my answer to the question is, you have to decide whether what we ask is right or wrong. If it is right, and force is necessary, you have to apply it. If it is wrong, not only you do not have to apply force, but you do not have to allow it. It is a question of right and wrong, and not whether to apply or not to apply force, as in any other conflict in the world. And this is the reason the United Nations was established.\n\n&gt;Mr. RAND   (Canada):  I suppose that is one case in which you can resort to absolutes.\n\n&gt;Mr. BEN GURION: No absolutes. This was the reason why we were ready in 1937 I mean the majority-to consider a compromise. **Although we knew we were entitled to an entire country, when the British Government came and told us the result of that Commission, they said, you are right, but this will require force and we do not want it and we cannot do it, and therefore we tell you here is a compromise. The majority said, that they were willing to consider it.**  \n\n\n  \n...  \n\n\n&gt;  \nCHAIRMAN: I think, Mr. GARCIA GRANDOS, that you overlooked one factor in Mr. BEN GURION's previous answer. **This transition period was aimed at creating a Jewish majority, and that is the reason for the supervision.**\n\n&gt;Mr. GARCIA GRANDOS (Guatemala): **That is why I would like to ask you whether it refers to the whole of Palestine or to part of Palestine the transition period, I mean.**\n\n&gt;Mr. BEN GURION: **I said that in a part of Palestine we do not need any transitional period.

If that’s not the case, then you’re a manipulative liar trying to throw dirt in people’s eyes by positioning Islamists as a victims (be aware I’m referring to Islamists, not the same as Muslims). \nIt’s not the 40’s anymore where everything is hearsay based. They speak clearly and it’s neither of our places to interpret the meaning, just translate. Listen to their imams on MEMRITV. Listen to their people interviewing. I don’t even need to demonize them, they do all the work by themselves. 💁‍♀️ Listen and look at the visuals coming out of Iran, Syria, Iraq, Sudan, Nigeria, Yemen.. look at what they do to the Druze. I can keep going. When they don’t go for the Jews they’ll go for the Christians.. the Hindus.. whoever’s not an Islamist like they are. When they run out they just go for each other. It’s in their charter just like it is in their DNA, educated to hate from the day they are born. They’re not even hiding it. A caliphate will be built on our heads if we don’t take it seriously and fast. I despise sharia and all that’s related to it. Whoever likes it can go back to the hell hole countries they crawled out of. This sh!t doesn’t have any right to exist in a civilized society, or world. I said what I said. If you fancy sharia f* off to one of the 57 states that live by it and rot there.",

If you don’t use any form of family planning you have a 20% chance of getting pregnant. It is easy to talk yourself into sex if you think there is an 80% chance you’ll be okay.

Or they could be like the Deep South USA classes that say 100% abstinence is the only way to be safe and pure and girls can use the birth control of keeping a penny between her knees. Condoms are actually a good one because many people are actually not aware of how to properly store condoms, how to properly apply, how to tell if the condom breaks and what to do if it does. But condoms, if used perfectly, has a 98% success rate for pregnancy and an effective rate of 85-87% because of the above issues. That means that out of 100 people all using condoms you can expect every year 15-17 of them will have a baby. Actually it’s probably higher as it obviously can count how many women got pregnant but it does as a zygote or morula or blastocyst and such. The numbers would be lower if the Pill was also used then it would be lower. However, I don’t know how much access they have to the Pill or condoms. I can’t imagine the refugee camps are full of condoms when they are focusing on food.",

It's true, they're still pumping 'em out far above the international average, but we must remember that this average is falling both the world over and of course within Palestinian society within and outside the territories. For Palestinians within Israel and the territories the fertility rate used to be around 9, which was an \\*eye-watering\\* number. The immediate diaspora was probably similar, given their rate of growth. Still, it's down to either half that or in some cases approaching a more a \"western\" rate, depending on where you look and who you look at. \n\nNow, we don't really have the data necessary to make an accurate assessment of how the present stage of the conflict will affect fertility rates either now (reported births are reportedly down 41%, but \"recorded births\" is the operative phrase here) or within the next few years. However, we can make some ballpark speculation and assume it'll probably go up. Access to healthcare was a \\*big\\* reason for the global drop in fertility over the 20th century, since it upended one of the main reasons for pumping out kids, which was general childhood mortality. Well, the healthcare system is in ruins and will probably remain so for at least a few years. And the natural human response to increased childhood mortality, as we've seen the world over, is really just \"keep on pumpin' \". Y'know, roll the dice, if you make more well then at least a couple of em might make it to adulthood. That'll probably lead to a brief explosion in fertility if healthcare is rebuilt rapidly, as was the case with the 20th century expansion of healthcare infrastructure, which should of course occur for moral reasons but even so one must acknowledge what can also occur alongside.",

    "body": "&gt; Save the Children reported more children had died in three weeks in Gaza than in the entire sum of conflicts around the world in the past four years.\n\n\"In January 2025, Yasmin Ghaffar, a member of Save the Children UK’s public affairs team, posted a blatantly antisemitic TikTok video. In it, she asked her followers for recommendations for bagels in New York, specifying, “I don’t want to be giving any of my money to genocidal maniacs,” and adding that she was looking for shops that are either “actively pro-Palestinian” or “known to not be in support of that hell-hole place and Zionism” – clearly seeking to avoid Jewish-owned stores.\"\n\n\"On October 17, 2023, in response to an explosion outside the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, Save the Children’s Country Director for the West Bank and Gaza Jason Lee said stated, “Our worst fears are being realized. We’re seeing schools and hospitals – places of safety and sanctuary – being targeted. Civilian infrastructure like hospitals and schools must be protected at all times.” Lee ignored the videos, images, and intelligence materials demonstrating that an Islamic Jihad rocket had “misfired” (i.e. detonated in Gaza instead of Israel) and hit the hospital parking lot.\"\n\n\"In October 2020, Save the Children published a report on “the impact of the Israeli military detention system on Palestinian children.” Save the Children itself acknowledged that the data presented in the publication “is not a statistically significant or representative sample. As the report intentionally presents children’s experience from their own perspective, it is also important to note that incidents they mention have not been independently verified by Save the Children”. The report severely downplays the extent and severity of violence committed by Palestinian minors against Israeli civilians and soldiers, and ignores the widespread phenomena of incitement prevalent in the West Bank.\"\n\n\n\"In November 2018, during the violence on the Gaza border, Save the Children stated that “The Israeli government must end the use of sniper fire and live ammunition against children in Gaza. The killing and wounding of children is never acceptable.” Save the Children does not question why these children were present in an obviously violent situation where there was a known potential for injury, nor does the organization condemn Hamas and other Palestinian terror groups’ recruitment and use of children throughout the violence. The NGO also ignored the violent nature of the protests, which have consisted of an organized armed attack on the Israeli border and IDF positions, attempts to destroy and breach the border fence, and sustained arson, rocket, and mortar attacks on Israeli civilian communities.\"\n\n\n\"On May 18, 2018, Save the Children and the Palestinian Center for Democracy and Conflict Resolution sponsored a workshop at the Dar al Huda kindergarten, “Training of Teachers on Positive Discipline in Everyday Teaching.”\nOn May 26, 2018, the Dar al Huda kindergarten in Gaza held a graduation ceremony that included the mock killing and kidnapping of Israelis by children dressed as combatants.1 The simulation included sophisticated equipment such as drones, body cameras, military fatigues, body armor, and sniper camouflage. Children wore headbands representing Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), designated as a terrorist organization by the US, EU, and others.\"\n\n\n\"During the 2014 Gaza conflict, Save the Children published a full-page advertisement in papers throughout the UK of the names of Palestinian children who were killed; a similar list of Israeli children was not produced.\"\n\n\n\"Save the Children has repeatedly joined in the demonization campaign falsely accusing Israel of employing starvation as a method of warfare against Hamas. These allegations have been repeatedly shown to be based on fundamental methodological errors and overwhelmingly disproven by publicly available information.\"",

Attacks occurred at various locations, including shopping centers, public buses, transit stations, cafes, nightclubs, and restaurants, According to a 2006 study from the University of Haifa, only a few of the bombings targeted military objectives.

If there are other good reasons to have the civil war, then that is a separate conversation, but this is a devastating compromise that you can’t put back in the box easily and worse doesn’t actually guarantee the thing you are looking for. This would be like trying to cure a hand infection by cutting off your finger. It might work but that’s an option you don’t want to do unless you absolutely must. \n\nIran doesn’t have an enemy that actually wants to treat it like the Iranian leadership says it does and that has been a key factor for the revolution to begin in Iran. The Palestinians have no such out because they are intimately familiar with what Israel is actually doing to them and has said they want to do to them. Most people on the pro Israel side see the Iranian citizens as good, human, intelligent people and Israel and the US’s actions in the 12 day war have given people confidence in that statement. Gaza is in a different situation because the Israelis do actually see the Gazans with a lack of humanity and primarily as a threat that has to be dealt with who are primarily evil. \n\nI cannot stress this enough, these protests in Iran aren’t nearly as successful if the Iranian people don’t believe that the Iranian regime is lying to them about their primary foreign adversaries. The Gazans have no hope to change their mind on this matter because they are fundamentally correct about their assumptions about Israel’s opinion of them. \n\nThe Iranian people are forced to choose between the regime and something completely different if possible. The Gazans have to choose between  Israel and Hamas with Israel’s restrictions. Considering Israel’s policies towards the Palestinians until this point and the insistence that the Palestinians can’t all be citizens of Israel, do you see why this option for the Palestinians is dramatically harder to pick than for the Iranians?",

For the Palestinians we have the data about how the Israelis don’t see the Palestinians as human\n\n“When asked about the level of humanity of other side, Palestinians gave Jews an average score of 6 out of 100; Jews gave Palestinians an average score of 14. 51% of Jewish Israelis gave Palestinians a score of zero” https://pcpsr.org/en/node/989\n\nThe Palestinians are far worse than the Israelis on this matter, but if the issue is if those who would be revolutionaries believe that the other side sees them as human, then the Iranian public would be correct to say that Israelis see Iranians as people. The Palestinians would be demonstrably and provably correct in saying that Israelis do not see the Palestinians as human. And if we are talking about a revolution possibility, then who other than Israel is going to fill the opportunistic void left by Hamas? It’s going to be Israel since they have the military dominance and can increase their security by doing so. \n\nIsraelis assign more humanity to Palestinians than the Palestinians assign to Israelis. If you are aware of how much humanity Israelis assign to Palestinians, that is grim in every scenario.\n\nWith Russia, the waters are extremely muddy on this front.

The soldiers are typically the desperate sort who had little choice but to join the meat grinder. Ukraine has managed to get a LOT of soldiers who defect because of the strong asymmetry between the motives of the soldiers and the motives of the Russian government.

If by \"the situation in Iran\" one means the fall of the Mullah's, unfortunately that seems less and less in the cards at present.\n\n\\*However\\*, it does seem like Iran is going to stay in prolonged economic crisis for a while that will limit its ability to fund groups like Hamas, since of course between allocating money for this sort of thing and allocating it for IRGC paycheques it's sort of an obvious choice. It loses the latter well then now the regime \\*could\\* fall. So, all in all a diminished Hamas can sort of be expected, unless someone decides to now announce to foot the bills.\n\nAs for what changes, well that's difficult to say, since really it's a matter of how things shake out with the interim administration. Apparently, the head of the proposed interim admin has went and said he'd rebuild the place in 7 years and make new Gazan land by just pushing all the rubble into the sea (with bulldozers he doesn't have), \\*very\\* bold claims for a former deputy minister of of Transportation. It's important to note that Hamas used to operate with much less of a budget, but thrived because of the failures of the government it contended against. If the interim admin fares the same, well then people start saying \"man I miss Hamas\" then it's kinda back to square one, albeit in a much-diminished form. You know, no more fancy smuggled rockets and back to just jumped up RPG rounds on a metal tube, if those are even in the budget.",

This could deter any uprising. But at the same time, many people in Gaza do agree with some of Hamas' actions, such as October 7.\n\nWe have seen uprising and protest in the past, especially in this war, although I do not think the people of Gaza will act unless Hamas really does something to trigger them or Hamas becomes weak enough without Iranian aid to make it easy to overthrow.",

By claiming to be some shield against the “savage Arabs and Palestinians” and saying that the country is for Jews and protects them, you act on Jews’ behalf even when they don’t want to be associated with a kid-bombing country.  3. I can’t find this document anywhere just people talking about it. Can you link it? Also, I’m a little skeptical seeing how it mentioned that a commander was killed for being gay when it’s unconfirmed if that story is true. The video you linked is the same story. The people sexually assaulted or raped by Hamas were Israeli hostages, it isn’t some cartel-linked chain of traffickers. That is deplorable and I don’t support Hamas at all. I support resistance and since they are the resistors right now I support the cause but not everything they do. \n\nSidenote: Imagine if all Jews hated Black people during the Holocaust but Black people around the world continued to protest and lobby for intervention to stop the Nazis from murdering the Jews, would you tell those protestors “Oh but if you were in Hungary they would eat you alive”? Obviously not. I can’t find recognize a genocide and say “That’s wrong”, I don’t care what the victims of that genocide thinks of me. It’s prob the stupidest fucking point.",

I also don’t think we should throw molotov cocktails at protestors so I’m glad we agree. I was saying that Israel fuels some of the anti-semitism around the world. Some people just hate Jews and antisemites use that as an excuse while others believe Israel represents the Jewish people when it doesn’t.\n\n1. Again, Mahmoud Ishwiti’s story isn’t confirmed and I haven’t seen any list of militants executed, just people talking about it.\n\n2. I literally never said it was ok please stop strawmanning me. I’m clarifying because the way you said it made it seem as if it was something similar to what cartels do. The first source you gave me said the children being taken advantage of was a result of the war but those unsavory characters would still be around but it doesn’t really back up your claim, just goes to show another bad thing that happened because of the war. The second source just highlights the things Israel is doing wrong to prevent labor trafficking. Third source is horrible but Hamas and ISIS are enemies so how would one be an ISIS and Hamas member?",

Russia actually IS engaging in atrocities, but people aren't attacking westerners of Russian descent.

They had their own language, own culture, own history, own kingdom before they were conquered and absored by Japan. \n\nNow, mors than ever Japan and neighboring countries need that US military base to remain there to help deter Chinese aggression. Article 9 of Japaness constitution prohibits war and offensive forces. The US military base there is meant to protect Japan, among other objectives. Things are changing, Japan does have a well-equipped self defense force and a growing trend to amend the constitution. \n\nEven then, Japan and other neighboring countries will feel better with a US military base in the region to help deter Chinese aggression andmaintain peace in the region.\n\nhttps://asia.nikkei.com/spotlight/trump-administration/iran-crisis-sparks-concern-of-loss-of-us-carrier-coverage-in-asia (English language Newspaper based in Japan) Iran crisis sparks concern of loss of US carrier coverage in Asia.

It was fairly easy to be a classic liberal in favor of world peace and a stable international order, including the 2SS process, in the 1990s. But the peace process got us nowhere, and withdrawal from Gaza got us 20 years of Hamas.\n\nAs for the worst rhetoric, I mean, the same comes from 'your' side, both from the actual Muslims, who are *deeply* right wing, and call openly and proudly for genocide of Jews every time they open their mouths, to their allies on the left, who seem to have little problem un-masking and marching to slogans like 'gas the Jews.'\n\nI don't think Palestinians are fake, but I'm not sure that their identity is special in any way various other ethnic identities in the region or the entire world isn't, that it means they have more rights to not just a state, but all the land they want, in exclusion of other people. Why do they deserve more than the Kurds? Or the Catalonians? And while there is racist Islamophobia, Islamophobia has also clearly become a default go-to shield to excuse the obvious and open horrors of global Islamic society. I can reject both, call a duck a duck, and call the violent, sexist, homophobic, racial-and-religious supremacists extremists in charge of every sharia society across the planet the primitive chuds and threats to the human race that they are.\n\nUltimately, I consider that my movement hasn't been from the left to the right, but from idealist to realist. Going back to Gaza, pulling out got 20 years of increased violence of the worst kinds. Land for peace is disproven. We've now basically reset to square one. At that point, is it logical to try and do the same thing again? Do you expect the outcome to be different the 2nd time around? Or do you admit that the assumptions of the peace process in that era were probably flawed, and you have to look at different more realistic solutions.",

But I can still work from extrapolation and induction in terms of what has been tried, and what the outcomes have been. Gaza proved that peace for Israel next to an armed Palestinian state is impossible (and it was only unofficially armed; the idea that the outcome wouldn't be 10x worse with Iran able to freely ship in weapons without a blockade is... lol). Democratic processes in the Middle East overwhelmingly elect violent jihadists (see not only Gaza, but pre-coup Egypt). It is absolutely part of what the average Muslim wants. So self-ruling, armed, fully sovereign Palestinians? Yeah, not realistic for a policy goal of 'Peace.' \n\nWhat remains isn't really pretty. Occupation in the near term. Puppet governments and heavy external interference in the medium term. Maybe some kind of controlled federal system in the very long term, if the Palestinians can actually start to de-radicalize through those prior eras. That last one is probably 50+ years out.",

All of them are very much against settlers in the West Bank and would bring them into ‘67 borders tomorrow if possible. All of them hate Netanyahu with a passion.\nThe naqba and right of return is more complicated. Most of them have a lot of empathy for individual Palestinians who suffered. They were taught about Deir Yassin as a terrible thing. But most of them also are deeply skeptical that a land where they are not the majority would be safe for them. Zionism is for them in part a deep connection to a historic homeland but mainly a way to be in charge of one’s own political destiny. If the country had not been majority Jewish, the Palestinian leadership at the time made it clear it would have wanted to cut Jewish immigration off. And part of the point is to always have a place that Jews can escape to — and did, even post 1948. So many of them are still for a two state solution for that reason.\nHope that helps.",

Jerusalem, for example, I think needs to be an international city managed by elected officials from all three major religions with a shared vision of preserving what is there and helping give access to religious rites and practices, especially during holy holidays etc.\n\nAnd I guess... for people who lost their land and homes, what happens to them in a world where they can't be permitted back so Jewish people can have control over a land that is theirs? How do we repair what was taken from them? Especially in a way that is fair. How can that repair be made without Palestinians essentially becoming a colony or refugee camp of Israel? Which is what we see today, but in a way that just sows animosity and spite. How can we adjust this so it becomes mutually beneficial, with both sides coming to agreement. \"Yes, we Palestinians will relinquish our homes to you that were taken, but we enter into this covenant that makes us brothers as we share this land that means so much to both of us\" -- what would get them to say that?

I've never encountered any serious Christian Zionist teacher or book claiming that Jews need to gather in Israel so they can all die horribly while Christians get raptured to heaven, and honestly that's such a cartoonish misrepresentation that it makes me wonder where you even got this idea from because it sure wasn't from actually reading what these people believe. The actual theological framework most Christian Zionists work from comes straight out of the Tanakh (books like Zechariah and Ezekiel written by *your* prophets) which prophesy that in the last days Israel will be restored, attacked by nations, and then God will personally intervene to defend them and judge the world based on how they treated the Jewish people, and plenty of Christians also draw on their own scriptures which predict that *Christians* (not Jews) will face severe persecution before Christ returns, so if anything the shoe's on the other foot regarding who's supposedly dying horribly.\n\nYou're also confusing the rapture with the second coming which suggests you don't actually understand the eschatological framework you're critiquing, and not even all Christian Zionists believe in a pre-tribulation rapture anyway so you're attacking a position that isn't even universally held among the group you're criticizing. What's really going on here is that many Christians support Israel for the same reasons other Westerners do (shared democratic values, common threats, cultural affinity) and yes some *also* have theological reasons rooted in believing that God's covenantal promises to the Jewish people still stand, but reducing that to \"they want us all dead so they can go to heaven\" is exactly the kind of bad faith misrepresentation that anti-Zionists use to drive wedges between Israel and one of its most reliable support bases. You can disagree with Christian eschatology all you want but at least represent what people actually believe before you call them creepy, because right now you're essentially repeating talking points designed by people who want to isolate Israel by convincing Jews that their Christian allies are secretly hoping for their destruction, which is both factually wrong and strategically foolish.",

Other questions are generalizations based on fair arguments. I'm not sure what the analogy for \"Zionist is a slur\" - that Islam has bad rep? Let's try to answer your Q's:\n\n&gt;palestinians are squatters on jewish land\n\nSaid by those who believe the land is Jewish either because it used to be ruled by Jews (historical precedence) or the providence of God to the Jews (religious doctrine). The former is fallacy (right by might and the Jews lost), and the latter is stupid - unless you're religious, in which case you just believe whatever you want.\n\n&gt;palestinians are arabs from arabia, jordan, and egypt\n\nIt's an ignorant take - the Arab conquest Arabized the locals, it didn't replace them with Arabs. I think it doesn't matter because the Arabs that are in Palestine today are Palestinians enough, for all intents and purposes. But it wasn't always the case.\n\n&gt;palestinians are a fake people\n\nProbably rooted in the Palestinian nationality being a recent concept. The first *Palestinian* Arab congress took place in 1919. The local elites defined their \"Palestinian\" identity thusly:\n\n&gt; We consider Palestine nothing but part of Arab Syria, and it has never been separated from it at any stage. We are tied to it by national, religious, linguistic, moral, economic, and geographic bounds\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Syria\n\nIdentities evolve and so do national identities. It took decades past this point for the modern Palestinian identity to coalesce, and I believe it wouldn't have become distinguishable from Syrian or Pan-Arab identity had it not been for the Jews emerging as a local sovereignty, while the rest of the Arabs were defeated in claiming the land and its inhabitants for themselves.\n\nI'll remind you that, in the decades following Israel's creation, Egypt, Jordan and Syria invaded Palestine to claim it for themselves, not to \"free the Palestinians\".\n\n&gt;\"muslim behavior is the reason for islamophobia\"\n\nA generalization ignoring bigotry and racism. But let's look at some dry statistics:\n\n\\- All Arab states are dictatorships\n\n\\- Islam is the dominant religion in the world's most violent countries\n\n\\- Islam is the dominant religion in global terrorism\n\nCombine these 3 with Islam's expansionist doctrine and natural demographics, and you've got a good reason to fear Islam.\n\n&gt;\"why should palestinians get western treatment when they behave like animals\"\n\nThis is a bit of a generalization, and I don't know about \"animals\", but *collectively*, Palestinians do not adhere to Western values. The idea that Palestinians would somehow erect a western democracy, let alone sustain one, is complete fantasy and has no historical evidence to support it.",

I think you need to check Ayn Rand and why any right that is contingent on another person providing it as your slave is not an actual right. If USA and Israel are the only countries who voted against this, then it's truly sad, and socialism won. \n\n\nTo answer your question though Israel voted because US voted. Israel votes with US because that's the special relationship and Israel is an ally of the US. Of course then the \"woke right\" asks why Israel is an ally. This is why. Israel votes automatically with US in every UN resolution and in returns *hopes* (with no guarantees at all) that US vetos anti Israel resolutions (on the UNSC). Unfortunate that Israel did not develop more relationships with other veto countries although before the Ukraine war it made great progress with Russia. And there is potential with China but it's blocked by the US. Complicated relationships with France and UK who usually give in to the Arabs.\n\n\nThe support of Israel to the US is the *only* reason why Israel voted like this. Ideologically, and unfortunately in my opinion since I support the Ayn Rand objectivist view, Israel is a very socialist minded country. The \"Left\"  in Israel usually supports this idea of food as a right and the Jewish Orthodox and Muslims in Israel obviously do too... And then you are left with the \"Right\", well surprisingly the Right in Israel is NOT actually capitalist, and the spiritual leader of the secular right was Zeev Zabotinsky (father of the predecessor of the Likud) and he famously declared that not only was food a right but also housing and clothes and education and health.\n\n\n \"Capitalism\" in Israel especially in the last 30 years was driven somewhat by Netanyahu (personally with a few other individuals) and by some forces in the Left and even the more radical Left actually.

And the concern with codifying it as a right is that it then binds uninvolved parties to fix problems out of their control.\n\nUp until recently, most of the burden of providing humanitarian aid has fallen on the United States and so it's easy for other countries who don't expect to have to fill the gaps to vote on a resolution that sounds good, but wouldn't obligate them to intervention.\n\n  \nHere's the official statement from the US: https://geneva.usmission.gov/2017/03/24/u-s-explanation-of-vote-on-the-right-to-food/.  Much of it talks about specific language in the resolution, but it ends with this: \"Furthermore, we reiterate that states are responsible for implementing their human rights obligations.  This is true of all obligations that a state has assumed, regardless of external factors, including, for example, the availability of technical and other assistance.\n\nWe also do not accept any reading of this resolution or related documents that would suggest that States have particular extraterritorial obligations arising from any concept of a right to food.\n\nLastly, we wish to clarify our understandings with respect to certain language in this resolution.  The United States supports the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living, including food, as recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Domestically, the United States pursues policies that promote access to food, and it is our objective to achieve a world where everyone has adequate access to food, but we do not treat the right to food as an enforceable obligation.  The United States does not recognize any change in the current state of conventional or customary international law regarding rights related to food.  The United States is not a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  Accordingly, we interpret this resolution’s references to the right to food, with respect to States Parties to that covenant, in light of its Article 2(1).  We also construe this resolution’s references to member states’ obligations regarding the right to food as applicable to the extent they have assumed such obligations.\"",

I'm not aware of Israel publishing its reasoning, but they do have a longstanding tradition of voting alongside the USA.\n\nHere is the USA's reason for voting \"no\" as described in the document: \n\n1. The draft did not offer meaningful, concrete steps to solving the problem.\n2. It did not give enough focus on famine often being primarily manmade, the result of conflict. The way to resolve those famines is by ending the conflicts.\n3. It inappropriately discussed trade, which had already been covered in other treaties.\n4. It contained some specific line items with which the USA disagreed. Specifically, on pesticides, on climate change, and on technology transfer.\n5. The responsibility for implementing human rights obligations is on the state, not on the international community.\n\nThey wrap it up with this (emphasis mine):\n\n&gt;**The United States supports the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living, including food**, as recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Domestically, the United States pursues policies that promote access to food, and it is our objective to achieve a world where everyone has adequate access to food, but **we do not treat the right to food as an enforceable obligation.**",

The United States, working with concerned partners and relevant international institutions, is fully engaged on addressing this crisis. \n\n&gt;This Council, should be outraged that so many people are facing famine because of a manmade crisis caused by, among other things , armed conflict in these four areas... This resolution distracts attention from important and relevant challenges that contribute significantly to the recurring state of regional food insecurity, including endemic conflict, and the lack of strong governing institutions. \n\n(As an aside: it's crazy to me that this document was so poorly edited.

Basically, Palestine existed as much the nowadays Russian-engineered and created Donetsk People's Republic.\n\nPalestine only then existed after the Roman Empire wiped out and genocided Kingdom of Israel and that too only as a part of a colonial empire never as an independent state or kingdom. From then on it went through Arab Conquest, Ottoman Empire and then finally the British Empire under it's own British Mandate of Palestine 1917-1948 which is the closest it ever got to a state. Even after that though Egypt and Jordan occupied parts of it, Egypt did Gaza and Jordan the West Bank from 1948-1967 after which Israel won those territories due to victory in the Six Days War 1967. Israel then left 4 settlements in the WB and Gaza in 2005 giving an opportunity for a Palestinian state but even nowadays it is not a state and only the PLO has observer status at the UN regarding Palestine.\n\nPro-Palestinian activism centers around the 2SS or 2 State Solution as one of its points precisely because Palestine is not a state yet otherwise 2SS would have 0 meaning.\n\n**So either pro-Palestinan activism partially has 0 meaning or Palestine is not and was never a state?

The concept of Indonesian was a project started by an anti-colonialist political party, Sarekat Islam, who in 1912, promoted the idea that 'Indonesian' was any person living under Dutch colonial rule in the Dutch East Indies (they were initially founded to oppose Chinese traders, but within a year pivoted to Indonesian nationalism). This arcepelego spanning concept of nationality, for a time, competed with the Island based independence movements, that promoted natavist, blood and land, concept of nationality. The more familiar inherited nationality. In the 1920-30s these natavist independence movements disbanded and merged with the arcepelego spanning nationality, both were united in their opposition to Dutch colonial rule. In 1945, shortly after Japanese occupation ended, Indonesian nationalists declared independence, resulting in a conflict between Indonesian nationalists, the Dutch colonial power (and allied countries) and well as an internal struggle, often against communists (a bit of a mess). Over 100,000 people were killed.",

The people of Palestine have had different religions. \n\n\nIn the beginning of the the 20th century some Europeans began to buy small areas of land in the north of Palestine. They were zionists. The zionosts continued to committ terrorist acts and murder Palestinians and Brits (at this time Palestine was a part of the British empire). \n\n\nIn 1948 the Brits signed over Palestine to the zionists to create a country called \"israel\" in the Balfour declaration. The zionists began to mass-murder the Palestinians, they burned their villages, put entire families and communities in fenced areas and then used machine-guns to shoot them all in mass-murders. The zionists forced millions of Palestinians to leave Palestine under the threat of murder. We don't know exactly how many Palestinians were killed.\n\n\nSo, no. Occupation is not a good thing. Maybe in your country the land-owners illegitmately bought the land from corrupted politicians and people just try to survive by living on it. In Palestine the israelis are masd-mutdering people, they even murder children, to empty the land of people who have lived there for thousands of years. The American/zionist plan for Gaza is to build luxury hotels and luxury homes. Does that seem like something people struggling to survive would do or is it something \"big landowners\" would do?",

If Zionists are willing to publicly threaten violence against a small Jewish woman for holding a sign, someone they purport to want to protect, then just imagine the unspeakable cruelty they inflict on the Palestinians behind closed doors (and frankly also publicly). They can't help but show who they really are to the world.\n\nSo if my being there and being threatened by Zionists can help gain support for Palestine and help the Palestinian resistance in anyway, then good.

Let's take the example of Orbán:\n\n1. Adopting language of the \"battle of civilizations\"? Check\n2. Refusal to compromise with regional rivals and his focus on national power? Check\n3. Not sure what you mean by an \"anti-Islam, security-focused nationalist state\" since Israel is more Muslim demographically and by extension culturally than many European countries but if Israel is, Hungary is. Check\n4. Treating the press as a Liberal enemy that targets the right and its values? Check\n5. Relevant in his country's politics since the 90s? Check\n\nAnd I would say Orbán has been way more influential on the many new European right-wing movements that have emerged or are emerging than Netanyahu. I mean, it is quite evident this is the case when you actually listen to the public conversations around these topics and movements, both online and in the real world. Ever since the 2015 migrant crisis and the birth of this \"new right\", you would see many people saying things like \"look at Poland and Hungary, we must be more like them,\" not \"I wish our country was more like Israel.\"   \nI am sure most Europeans engaged in politics at least on a basic level heard of \"some Orbán guy\" who is \"anti-EU\" and \"anti-immigration.\" On the other hand, I think the knowledge of most Europeans on who Netanyahu was prior to October 7th didn't go much beyond \"he is the president of Israel or something, right?\" Which would explain why I basically never heard of Netanyahu in public discussions prior to the War in Gaza, but I heard of figures like Viktor Orbán or even Jarosław Kaczyński quite a bit.\n\nAnyway, you have right-wing figures who are eager to cooperate and ally with Israel to fight Islam, sure. I find the notion that they *\"see Netanyahu not as a foreign leader, but as a peer-commander in a shared struggle\"* because Israel is in their eyes *\"the wall between Western civilization and barbarism\"* frankly absurd though. Sure, you could say this about some right-wing public figures I guess and you mentioned some in your post. There are also many other right-wing figures who range from openly anti-semitic to seeing Israel as some country far away which is just an ally because of current circumstances, not because of some civilizational kinship.",

I have seen another one of these posts in r/geopolitics talking about the Islamization of Turkey.\n\nIIf trump decides to capture Greenland, you can stick your Civilizational BS up your bumbum where it belongs.  Because of Greenland, the Western world will split, and Europe itself will fracture. What you will get is something that looks like Europe before the French Revolution. The Western consensus will be dead.  Some will move to the left, and some to the right.  The world will go back to the world of transactional alliances, which is the world that Trump embraces\n\nIn this transactional world, Israel will be one of the biggest losers, because you people still think in civilizational terms.  Israel will most likely have to make a deal with Iran to counter the Sunni Alliance of Turkey because the US will no longer be able project power in the Middle East once its European bases are gone.\n\nFor there to be civilizational thinking a unified civilization order culture must exist; once it breaks down, people no longer talk in civilization terms, but in national terms, with each country forming alliances, often with countries of very different ideologies. Turkey in WW1 could have sided with the UK, and the US could have sided with Germany. People didn't see Turkey as an Islamic other, but just another power.\n\nI know as an Israeli, you like to wrap your comforting blanket of civilizational bigotry and hatred and mistakenly see Netanyahu as harbringer of a new era. No, he is, but a speed bump to a new world order where alliances are much more transactional and short-lived.  I suggest you read some books about European imperialism in Asia before 1800, which shows a world where Europeans sided with local kingdoms against other Europeans.  This was a world where Europeans adopted native customs and speech.\n\nYou think right-wing nationalism in the West will lead to more support of Israel, but that isn't true. It will just lead to more countries thinking about their national interest first, not on an absurd civilization that Israel is some sort of civilizational vanguard for the West.   Hating Muslims at home doesn't mean you want to kill them abroad.",

They are wary of our previous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and they hate Trump and everything he does. Unfortunately this party (50 percent of Americans) is not in power. So they are not part of the decision making at this moment. \n\nOn the Republican side, Trump wants this for his own reasons and most Iranian Americans are riding along bc they see it as the only way to free the country they love. Other Republicans don't want to get into a foreign war.  Trump did not ask ANYONE - not even his own party - before arresting Maduró.  Things are weird here.  America did a lot of that kind of stuff during the cold war but most of us thought those days were over. \n\nSo while Trump is making it sounds like everyone in America just agrees that we have the right to pick the next leader of Iran, that's not how most Americans feel. \n\nStay safe.

Hamas is a terrorist organization that commits terrorist acts while also oppressing its own people to stay in power.  \n\nIt's true that various groups throughout history have engaged in terrorism to achieve their goals in their effort for self-determination or to resist oppression. Success of using terrorism to achieve goals is in the single digit percentile. This may make it seem hypocritical about why Israel could get things this way and why Palestinians can't. To put simply, there is a fundamental difference between the actions besides it just being \"terrorism.\"  \n\nMany independence movements started with attacks against those who controlled them and others have pointed out the difference between Hamas being the government in power and the militias being different by nature in both of who they attacked and how they attacked. Times were also different back then as well as the situation. \n\nIt's simply noise when people argue that the Israel and Haganah formed the IDF while absorbing the Lehi and the Irgun. This is a pretty normal occurance. Look at the PLO. Look at how the US Army after the civil war had many former confederate soldiers and officers join. Reintegration of splinter groups and militias is pretty common in countries after a war when they need soldiers. \n\nIn short, anybody making this argument needs to first admit Hamas is a terror organization and their members are terrorists before any discussion can begin on \"but the zionist militias\"",

They were largely self-defensive throughout the British Mandate, and didn’t go on the offensive until the 1947-49 war, and even then only after Jewish Jerusalem had been under siege by Arab forces for months. I don’t agree with all the actions of the Haganah, like the expulsion of Palestinian Arab villagers in parts of the Galilee. But displacement is not the *same thing* as terrorism.\n\nI understand the argument of calling the Irgun and Lehi terrorist orgs at times, or at least saying they committed some terrorist acts. During the Arab Revolt of 1936-1939, there were many Arab attacks on Jewish civilians, which eventually led the Irgun to attack Arab civilians, with attacks like market bombings. Both the Arab attacks and the Zionist Irgun attacks may be seen as terrorism, as they both targeted civilians. Then, of course, there’s the Deir Yassin massacre by the Irgun and Lehi, in which &gt;100 civilians were massacred. Many people will also point to the King David Hotel bombing as evidence Irgun was a terror org, but I feel less strongly about this argument, as I have more sympathy for Arab villagers/civilians than for British police.\n\nIn *any case* though, even if you do believe that some early Zionist militias were terrorists, that *still* doesn’t mean you can’t also call Hamas a terrorist organization too—and on a larger scale. **Oct 7 was 10x the size of the Deir Yassin massacre.**\n\nEven if you think the Irgun and Lehi were terrorists, you can criticize Hamas as a terrorist org too.",

It was an organized militia meant to defend the Jewish civilians of Palestine because it was felt that the British could not protect them against attacks by Arabs. It became the defense organization for Jews in British Mandatory Palestine which was then organized and brought under the centralized control of the mainstream (Labor/Mapai) Zionists by David Ben-Gurion.\n\nEvery time this topic of early Zionism in British Mandatory Palestine comes up, the constant refrain from the anti-Israel side is: Jabotinsky, Irgun, Lehi. It's never the Haganah and David Ben-Gurion – and if they are brought up it's always an attempt to find the most nefarious and/or out of context statement or incident. It reminds me of the recent anti-Zionist attempts to smear Golda Meir, which I find both tragic and intellectually hilarious.",

    "body": "&gt; Every time this topic of early Zionism in British Mandatory Palestine comes up, the constant refrain from the anti-Israel side is: Jabotinsky, Irgun, Lehi. \n\nIn my opinion there's two reasons for this:\n\nThe first is because the Irgun and Lehi were not minor actors. The actions they took were hugely important and fundamentally shifted the political terrain in Palestine in the final years of the mandate. I don't think it's unreasonable to argue that they were the reasons why the British ultimately left Palestine. And beyond that, there's a reasonable case to be made that there wouldn't have been a civil war in 1947/1948 were it not for the Irgun and Lehi (although counterfactuals like this are very difficult to prove, of course). So, yeah - the Irgun and Lehi were important.\n\nThe second reason is that Begin (Irgun commander) and Shamir (Lehi commander) dominated Israeli politics from 1977 - 1992; which were hugely important years in cementing Israeli control over the West Bank. Their political party, Likud, has essentially dominated Israeli politics since 1977 with only a few short breaks. Meanwhile, Ben-Gurion's political party currently holds a grant total of *four* seats in the Knesset. So it's not unreasonable to look at the Irgun and Lehi as the predecessors to the contemporary political leadership of Israel.\n\n&gt; It's never the Haganah and David Ben-Gurion – and if they are brought up it's always an attempt to find the most nefarious and/or out of context statement or incident.\n\nYou're right though, pro-Palestinians *should* bring up the Haganah and Ben-Gurion more since Ben-Gurion was ultimately the architect of the Nakba. And the mass expulsion of Palestinians was mostly conducted by the Haganah operating on his orders.",

The Jewish Agency publicly condemned the Irgun's attack on the Haifa Oil Refinery, but also authorized an attack on the village of Balad al-Shaykh the day afterwards as \"revenge\" for the Jews who were killed after the explosions went off.

They can only be portrayed as passive actors helplessly bobbing on the tides of history, unable to take any action to positively affect their own situation.” \nAbdul Rahman Hassan Azzam, the Secretary-General of the Arab League, had declared in 1947 that, were a war to take place with the proposed establishment of a Jewish state, it would lead to \"a war of extermination and momentous massacre which will be spoken of like the Mongolian massacre and the Crusades.” Jamal Husseini, the Mufti’s brother, represented the Arab Higher Committee at the UN. He told the Security Council in April 1948 “of course the Arabs started the fighting. We told the whole world we were going to fight.” (Thus ensuring that Azzam would get the war whose consequences he anticipated)\n\nMore from Azzam: \n\n“The Arab world is not in a compromising mood. It’s likely, Mr. Horowitz, that your plan is rational and logical, but the fate of nations is not decided by rational logic. Nations never concede; they fight. You won’t get anything by peaceful means or compromise. You can, perhaps, get something, but only by the force of arms. We shall try to defeat you. I’m not sure we’ll succeed, but we’ll try. We were able to drive out the Crusaders, but on the other hand we lost Spain and Persia. It may be that we shall lose Palestine. But it’s too late to talk of peaceful solutions.” September 1947, cited in https://israeled.org/abdulrahman-azzam-pasha-rejects-compromise-zionists/\n\n\nHere’s another quote from August 1947--before the UN even voted on the Partition plan-- from  Fawaz al-Quwuqji, whose \"Arab Liberation Army\" subsequently invaded the British Mandate in the spring of 1948:“we will have to initiate total war. We will murder, wreck and ruin everything standing in our way, be it English, American or Jewish\". Had the Arabs accepted the first ever Palestinian state, there would have been no refugees.\n\nThe response to this is usually a justification of the Arab decision to resort to war, with simultaneous insistence that they were still nonetheless passive and without agency.  And then we get to the actual grievance that they genuinely didn’t have control over: *they didn’t want the Jews coming back to their indigenous homeland.* That is what they acted upon, and almost every choice their leaders have made has been for the worse. (Not that every choice Israeli leaders made was perfect; far from it.). But let’s give up the fiction that Arabs were just sitting around minding their own business when suddenly the Jews came in and drove them off.",

    "body": "&gt; First off, when does a liberation movement become a “terrorist” organization? There’s no single, universally accepted legal definition.\n\nYup, this is correct. I would say most people generally accept the idea that when a state actor commits an act of violence it is legitimate, whereas when a non-state actor commits a similar act of violence it is not legitimate (and is terrorism, instead).\n\nThis is \"value neutral\" in the sense that we might look at some non-state actors as heroic (freedom fighters?) and some state actors as evil or visa-versa.\n\nIt's worth saying that the line between \"state\" and \"non-state\" actors is often extremely thin. The Haganah was a non-state actor until May 15th, 1948 and then it suddenly became a state actor (called the IDF, of course). They were not the first terrorist organization to make the leap into being a legitimate state actor, nor were they the last.\n\n&gt; The underlying problem with the “both sides did it” approach is that it conflates historical context with contemporary morality. Criticizing Hamas today is about actions in the present, not the imperfect past of another group. History informs ethics, but it doesn’t provide carte blanche to excuse ongoing acts of violence. \n\nI generally agree with you on this. I do have one quibble here though.\n\nTo me one of the most disturbing things I see is the rhetoric of pro-Israel supporters who claim that Hamas are \"animals.\" Or that Palestinians don't love their children because Hamas sometimes stores weapons underneath schools. \n\nThe irony is not lost on me that the Haganah *also* stored weapons in schools and yet for whatever reasons pro-Israel people don't think that *they* didn't love their children. Both the Irgun and the Haganah committed horrible atrocities against Palestinian Arab civilians, but Israel has named streets after their leaders -- they aren't regarded as \"non-human animals.\" And so on and so forth.\n\nSo yes, previous acts of terrorism *do not ever justify* future acts of terrorism. But understanding the context can help humanize people. You don't have to *like* Hamas, but you certainly need to recognize that the people who do are in fact humans, just like Israelis.",

There is no evidence of the Haganah systematically fighting from schools with civilians inside.\n\nSo no, this isn’t “irony.” It’s a false equivalence built on a hypothetical instead of evidence.\n\nNow, second claim. Yes, Haganah committed atrocities. But saying “they committed atrocities” is not the same as saying “civilian harm was doctrine.”Tohar HaNeshek existed as a norm, not as a guarantee. Violations of restraint were debated internally, sometimes condemned, often justified as exceptional or retaliatory.\n\nThat already distinguishes it from Hamas, where attacks on civilians are celebrated, not apologized for, killing civilians is framed as religious duty. There is no concept of “violation.” It is the mission.\n\nIf a rule is broken, the rule still exists. If there is no rule, nothing is broken.\n\nThat distinction matters morally and legally.\n\nOne massacre does not define doctrine.

Palestinians have ties to Palestine. People with cultural and historic ties to a land can argue they should live in that land. I have no problem with that.

All the way from the second Aliyah in 1904-14, Palestinians were aware that some nation building was taking place. Hence the prominent Christian Arab anti-Zionist publications Falastin and Al-Karmil in 1910s. Furthermore, the Hassan McMahon correspondence of 1915-16 and the Balfour declaration of 1917 upset many Palestinians. Add to that land purchases from absentee landlords, Jewish-only labor in settlements and you have a recipe for resentment.  It is in this context that some Palestinians resorted to violent protests in 1920s. I do not excuse any attacks on civilians, and I readily condemn any such acts. My criticism is in the *systemic*, *premeditated* violence perpetrated by Irgun, Haganah, Stern militias under the comicity of the Jewish Executive on a scale that left 750,000 Palestinians homeless and stateless.\n\nAny argument that justifies vilification of a whole people and excuses their suffering is calling for collective punishment, which is inherently reprehensible.

The Arab Muslims and Turks horrifically mistreated the Jews in their midst for countless centuries BEFORE Zionism\n\nTheir is a very common misconception that comes up when we talk about this subject. Honestly I don't care at all what ethnic background anyone has and I fully respect however they identify. That is how I feel.. But I feel like I need to talk about this because the pro-Palestine / anti-semites keep bringing this up... This is why I am talking about it.

In the Arab and Turkish worlds, your ethnic background is considered to come from your father...\n\nSo let's, with a VERY simple example, see how this would play out. The Ottoman Turks preferred European wives. In the culture of the Oghuz Turks this was a non-issue. The ethnicity of the child was considered that of the father...\n\nSo let's look at this and make some VERY simple examples. It is the 11th century. An Oghuz Turkish man, looks and is ethnically 100% Asian and looks Asian... He has a child with a European woman. According to Ottoman and Arab culture, the child is 100% Oghuz Turk and is a full member of this tribe and is culturally a member of this group.\n\nBut GENETICALLY he is ONLY 50% Turkish. He is 50% Turkish and say, 50% Albanian or 50% Italian or whatever. So the son has some other leading position in the tribe or has some important position in the empire. Because the Ottomans PREFERRED European wives, HE gets a European wife, a woman who converted to Islam from say, the Caucuses or wherever. They have a child. Culturally the child is ALSO 100% Oghuz Turkish. But his DNA is NOW 75% European... you get it? Culture is not the same as DNA...",

Ancient Hebrew has a lot of divergences, and they're pretty systemic in what those changes are.\n\n2: This is the key sticking point, and why Hebrew hasn't changed nearly as much as, say, English has: It's been essentially a dead language for two millennia. The Jewish diaspora used it for liturgy, but that was about it.\n\nWhat you see in modern Israel is revivalists resurrecting a dead language. But if you're considering this as being in a state of succession to ancient Israel, you may consider whether if modern Italians suddenly decided to switch the national language to Latin, if that would make them Romans.\n\nAs for why Arabic is spoken in the region now, it hardly bears mention; they were conquered, of course, and the language of the conquerors became a good language to know. Does that imply a loss of culture? Of course. But this is, as always, a relative question, and cultures evolve over the centuries.\n\nThat is as true of Levantine peoples as the Jewish diaspora.

The \"claim\" is really just that Jews needed a place to be safe given all of the pogroms (and then the Holocaust of course) in Europe, and that obviously would make sense to be in the land that they were forcibly removed from. Given the state of empires and the operating order of the world at the time of Herzl, it's not so crazy that buying land there would be seen as the moral and most practical approach. Now, it's not exactly fair to say that it was able to be sold in the first place given that the Palestinians were dominated by imperial power, but that's a modern day view and is not particularly applicable to the time period that Jews started buying land there.\n\nThe practicality, however, of effectively crowding out a place with a million people already, and establishing a Jewish state in Muslim-conquered land and thinking it will go well, would probably have given me pause if I were Jews in the early 1900s. Following the Holocaust, though, and that the plan was already well in progress and Britain had the mandate to do something about it, I don't think any people would do anything differently than trying to establish some kind of state there. I think people severely underplay just how much the Cold War made it so that it would turn into a constant proxy conflict, rather than there potentially being a viable future for some kind of binational South Africa-style state. I don't think the Arabs ever would have gone along with it anyway, but I think it would have been much more justifiable, and \\*maybe\\* workable. The two-state solution, though, is, and has always been, a joke.",

Palestinians suffer the same \"oppression\" as the Germans did at the end of WWII — being in the middle of losing a war is \"oppressive.\" Germans toward the end of the war had to navigate checkpoints as Russia and the U.S. occupied Germany. They had to deal with a bad economy. You mention terrorism from Pakistan. Have you noticed that there aren't open borders between Pakistan and India? That is in part because that prevents Pakastani terrorists from being able to simply walk into Mumbai and kill people. Israelis do not want Palestinians to walk into Tel Aviv and kill people either.\n\nThe reality is, the solution is for the war to end. Until then, peacetime campaigns like \"free movement between Israel and Palestine\" and \"more startups in Palestine\" or whatever are meaningless. Israel is not going to sacrifice the lives of its own citizens so that Palestinians can have better jobs. Why do you think the checkpoints went up in the first place? Palestinians were stabbing and bombing Israeli civilians, and metal detectors stopped that.\n\nThe reason the war is going on for so long is that the Palestinian goal is to wipe out Israel. Palestinians have to give up that goal to have peace. Not just some of them — the majority of them. They have to start wiping out their own leaders who insist on fighting an endless war to achieve that goal.\n\nOR and possibly more realistically, the larger Muslims world needs to accept that Israel exists and isn't going anywhere, and stop using Palestinians as a pawn to help soothe their humiliation that Jews have a country. They need to offer Palestinians citizenship in their own countries so their constant refugee status can come to an end. They need to make some agreement with Israel to work on the details about how the rest of it will all work for the Palestinians who want to stay in the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nAfter the war ends, the other details can be worked out — economic opportunities and what not.",

Terrorism is the most egregious form of violent crime and is literally a national security issue, violent crime on the other hand can include stuff like murder which is treated under criminal law so very different legally and the impacts are also different.\n\nSettler terrorism is an issue that Israel tries but fails to grapple with, oppression on the other hand has Hamas and it's ilk as the perpetrators not Israel.",

The fact that the Israeli policy was to let them even exist as a neighbor and continue attacking for years, shows the mercy of Zionism.

It's important to contextualize all this properly otherwise it's impossible to understand this.\n\nThe vast majority of Arabs in the region have, for nearly a century, maintained the position that they oppose ANY self determination of Jews on any part of their indigenous land. This is not a conflict based on borders. Arabs have maintained an ideological position informed by Islam, and more recently by Nazi ideology that persista in the Arab world. There is a reason why my Iraqi Jewish family was offered compensation by post-war Germany. The Nazis were VERY active in the region, the Palestinian/Arab leadership were their buddies. Just to setup the situation.\n\nJews are a small ethnic minority in the region surrounded by very large, powerful neighbors that have tried to destroy them multiple times to create their own Arab-dominated ethnostates. That is the status quo of the region.\n\nPalestinians today are brazen because these forces (Arab neighbors) will support them until the last Palestinian breathes. When your neighbor has the position \"either you die, or we die trying\", the conversation basically ends. \n\nWhat about the Israeli side? Surely the same rhetoric exists? Israeli leadership has swung between \"we must offer land for peace like we did with Egypt\" to \"we will do nothing. Offer nothing, and not impede settlers, until we have a partner on the other side willing to talk\". \n\nMeanwhile, Palestinian leadership has left their people with nothing. Arafat, who is considered to be one of Palestines greatest heroes, died a multibillionaire and left his people with nothing. Hamas leaders get fat in Qatar, and Fatah are making bank off the status quo. Even if Israel tried to go out of its way to give Palestinians land of their own, there isn't even a partner to negotiate with.

Gaza is almost pacified so give it another year maybe and they'll be completely disarmed. Send in the wheel excavators and they could have the ground scrubbed of unexploded munitions and tunnels in less than another year. Start with a nice flat clean slate and some nice new tents, eliminate the antagonists like the UN and hamas and Gaza, in a generation or so might be ready for an easing of restrictions, who knows, I guess it depends on them if they want to live in peace or not. \n\nGiving up the settlements isn't going to happen, again nothing in it for Israel. Asking Israel to pay reparations is nuts, they didn't start it, speaking of which, the Israeli's are still owed reparations from when they were thrown out of all those Arab nations, and particularly in the West Bank by Jordan and in the Old Trans-Jordon. In the end reparations work out more in favor of Israel than the Arabs in the mandate area. Again, nothing in it for Israel. \n\nMy two cents is that plan would never work. I think a better plan would be for Gaza to voluntarily disarm immediately and peacefully evacuate all areas behind the yellow line as penance for the atrocities of 10/7. Surrender all hamas members to the Israeli army within 30 days or face consequences. \n\nThe West Bank is a whole other can of worms. \n\nAnyway its great that folks are trying to come up with solutions but its got to be equitable and it must take into consideration that Israel has been forced to defend itself from day one and has no reason to lift restrictions. Trust is something you gain over time and so far its been one terrorist act after another so, Israel has no incentive to lift restrictions. \n\nMy two cents   \nCheers.",

So might as well deal with it all at once and dig up the tunnels while your at it.  \nHere's my plan\n\nI'm sure the plan could be improved but the nuts and bolts are there.\n\nIsrael should take the coastline in Gaza, its a huge smuggling risk and if the Gazan's aren't going to willingly disarm then its a must. Say a one mile buffer zone between the water and the Arabs. Two would be better. Extend the Yellow line to the Wadi Gaza and take the coast along the entire strip. That'd pin hamas in a manageable area with no chance of importing any more weapons.\n\nThe order of operations should be something like.\n\n1. Evacuate all civilians south of the Wadi Gaza but within the current yellow line to the north.\n2. Wheel excavators sift and flatten the area within the yellow line south of the Wadi Gaza down to a depth of about 50 meters.\n3. evacuate all civilians north of the Wadi Gaza back to the south and within the existing yellow line except for a new buffer zone along the coast one mile deep.\n4. The new yellow line is moved forward to the Wadi Gaza taking an additional 25% or so of Gaza in reparations for failing to disarm and the atrocities of 10/7.\n5. wheel excavators flatten the area north of the Wadi Gaza.\n6. wheel excavators move on to flatten the remaining areas controlled by Israel behind the yellow line.\n\nResult.  \n7) All of Gaza is now cleared of unexploded munitions and buildings intact or otherwise, all rubble has been removed for recycling and use outside of Gaza. No salvageable building materials should be left within Gaza. Gaza is flat as a pancake ready to rebuild when conditions are met.  \n8) Hamas is now contained in an area of about 30 square miles of flat gravel sifted of any and all building materials and tunnels down to a depth of about 50 meters.  \n9) set up a 28 square mile refugee tent city and a 2 square mile POW camp.  \n10) Review and register all as they come to the aid stations within the new camp and place them accordingly.  \n11) Aid stations and resources should be controlled and operated by the IDF and all recipients certified as legit refugees.  \n12) The cost of clearing Gaza and operating the refugee camp should come out of the Gaza reconstruction fund or UN funds with the IDF being compensated for its participation. No NGOs should be allowed to participate.  \n13) POW camps should be run and funded in accordance with the Geneva Conventions  \n14) No reconstruction should begin until a period of ten years has passed without incident.\n\nIn the end you've created a legit refugee camp devoid of combatants and antagonistic influences and segregated the belligerents in the accordance with the Geneva conventions. Let the peace process begin. In a decade or so, reconstruction could begin as long as the refugees remain peaceful and build some trust with their Israeli neighbors first. \n\nThe problem thus far is that the UN refused to segregate combatants from non combatants and instead, actively supported their employ within the UN, thus subverting the entire goal of peace between the two parties.\n\nIsrael will need to start over with a clean slate in order to re educate the civilian population while incarcerating the radicals in the POW camp. POWs will need to remain incarcerated until deportations arrangements can be made.\n\nEmigration by the refugees should be immediately allowed to anywhere outside of the mandate area.\n\nThe solution is simple, confine the problem to a smaller and smaller areas and limit the risks through proper preparation of the site, which in this case means flattening all of Gaza. Those huge wheel excavators could handle it in no time. Less than a year depending on how many you have. I'd. say a half dozen of the Bagger wheel excavators would do the job in less than a year.\n\nCheers",

Given the divide between Gaza and the West Bank politically, I doubt the former would agree to this. I may be wrong though -- who knows? \n\nYou're trying to achieve a balance of taking-and-giving to make things fair--however, for both sides, most of what you're describing crosses important \"red lines\" that are unacceptable to each party. This, of course, is why the conflict persists. There's no real middle ground in this conflict. The Israelis don't want to give up land. The Palestinians won't give up their land claims or their \"right of return.\" \n\nAlso -- I'm not Jewish or Israeli -- but I know for a fact the Israelis will never accept a return to a divided Jerusalem. Partial withdrawal from the West Bank is imaginable. That could happen -- it's not impossible. It's been part of previous peace proposals. But I think Jerusalem is off the table for them.",

And Israeli citizenship is not a booby prize for losing a war with Israel. I do not want former Hamas or PIJ personnel and their families moving into Tel Aviv, or Haifa, or Qiryat Shmoneh.\n\nFurthermore, 80% of West bank settlers live close to the Green line in settlement blocs that can easily be exchanged with Israel. There is no need to relocate all of them. That's an unreasonable ask.\n\nWhat is more, besides E Jerusalem, all of the West Bank remains unannexed. So your distinction between \"unannexed\" and \"annexed\" doesn't make sense.\n\nAdditionally, the Israeli concern with Palestinian statehood now in the West Bank is that such a state without Israeli military presence may be used as a launch pad for attacks against Israel, like South Lebanon and Gaza were used. However, the West Bank is on Jerusalem's municipal border and just a few km from Tel Aviv and Ben Gurion airport, on higher ground. This plan does not address this security risk at all. There are no security guarantees. You demand that Palestine \"demilitarize\", but without the IDF there to ensure that, who is there to enforce it?\n\nNor are there any institutional demands on the Palestinians for statehood. The Palestinian national movement for a century has spent very little of its effort developing effective institutions for statehood. There are no requirements for Palestinians to develop effective state institutions. The current PA is weak and ineffective, and institutions are weak. Without strong state institutions, the Palestinian state is likely to devolve into conflict, which will inevitably used as an excuse to attack Israel, unless this piece is taken seriously.\n\nFinally, there is no demand of Palestinians to give up ideology of opposition to Israel and annihilation of the Jewish state. So long as that is the national ideology of Palestine, the result will be the same. This ideology is not \"radical\" in Palestinian society, but mainstream. Without a plan to deradicalize and actually have Palestinian society accept that Jews are not foreigners and Israel but belong there, and have a right to self determination, then we haven't moved an inch.",

    "body": "He also signed this [famous letter](https://global-politics.eu/albert-einsteins-1948-letter-york-times-comparing-israeli-politicians-nazis/) to the NY Times comparing the 'Freedom Party' to the the 3rd Reich, along with numerous other notable Jews from the period. Note the date. If he could see what it has become he would be rolling over in his grave.      \n\nDec 2, 1948      \nTO THE EDITORS OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:         \n\nAmong the most disturbing political phenomena of our times is the emergence in the newly created state of Israel of the “Freedom Party” (Tnuat Haherut), a political party closely akin in its organization, methods, political philosophy and social appeal to the NotSee and Fascist parties. It was formed out of the membership and following of the former Irgun Zvai Leumi, a terrorist, right-wing, chauvinist organization in Palestine.       \n\nThe current visit of Menachem Begin, leader of this party, to the United States is obviously calculated to give the impression of American support for his party in the coming Israeli elections, and to cement political ties with conservative Zionist elements in the United States. Several Americans of national repute have lent their names to welcome his visit. It is inconceivable that those who oppose fascism throughout the world, if correctly informed as to Mr. Begin’s political record and perspectives, could add their names and support to the movement he represents.        \n\nBefore irreparable damage is done by way of financial contributions, public manifestations in Begin’s behalf, and the creation in Palestine of the impression that a large segment of America supports Fascist elements in Israel, the American public must be informed as to the record and objectives of Mr. Begin and his movement.         \n\nThe public avowals of Begin’s party are no guide whatever to its actual character. Today they speak of freedom, democracy and anti-imperialism, whereas until recently they openly preached the doctrine of the Fascist state. It is in its actions that the terrorist party betrays its real character; from its past actions we can judge what it may be expected to do in the future.       \n\nAttack on Arab Village      \n\nA shocking example was their behavior in the Arab village of Deir Yassin. This village, off the main roads and surrounded by Jewish lands, had taken no part in the war, and had even fought off Arab bands who wanted to use the village as their base. On April 9 (THE NEW YORK TIMES), terrorist bands attacked this peaceful village, which was not a military objective in the fighting, killed most of its inhabitants “240 men, women, and children” and kept a few of them alive to parade as captives through the streets of Jerusalem. Most of the Jewish community was horrified at the deed, and the Jewish Agency sent a telegram of apology to King Abdullah of Trans-Jordan. But the terrorists, far from being ashamed of their act, were proud of this massacre, publicized it widely, and invited all the foreign correspondents present in the country to view the heaped corpses and the general havoc at Deir Yassin.       \n\nThe Deir Yassin incident exemplifies the character and actions of the Freedom Party.       \n\nWithin the Jewish community they have preached an admixture of ultranationalism, religious mysticism, and racial superiority. Like other Fascist parties they have been used to break strikes, and have themselves pressed for the destruction of free trade unions. In their stead they have proposed corporate unions on the Italian Fascist model.      \n\nDuring the last years of sporadic anti-British violence, the IZL and Stern groups inaugurated a reign of terror in the Palestine Jewish community. Teachers were beaten up for speaking against them, adults were shot for not letting their children join them. By gangster methods, beatings, window-smashing, and wide-spread robberies, the terrorists intimidated the population and exacted a heavy tribute.      \n\nThe people of the Freedom Party have had no part in the constructive achievements in Palestine. They have reclaimed no land, built no settlements, and only detracted from the Jewish defense activity. Their much-publicized immigration endeavors were minute, and devoted mainly to bringing in Fascist compatriots.      \n\nDiscrepancies Seen      \n\nThe discrepancies between the bold claims now being made by Begin and his party, and their record of past performance in Palestine bear the imprint of no ordinary political party. This is the unmistakable stamp of a Fascist party for whom terrorism (against Jews, Arabs, and British alike), and misrepresentation are means, and a “Leader State” is the goal.      \n\nIn the light of the foregoing considerations, it is imperative that the truth about Mr. Begin and his movement be made known in this country. It is all the more tragic that the top leadership of American Zionism has refused to campaign against Begin’s efforts, or even to expose to its own constituents the dangers to Israel from support to Begin.     \n\nThe undersigned therefore take this means of publicly presenting a few salient facts concerning Begin and his party; and of urging all concerned not to support this latest manifestation of fascism.       \n\n(signed)\n\nISIDORE ABRAMOWITZ, HANNAH ARENDT, ABRAHAM BRICK, RABBI JESSURUN CARDOZO, ALBERT EINSTEIN, HERMAN EISEN, M.D., HAYIM FINEMAN, M.

Einstein was even at times critical (to third parties like Max Born) about people in power in Israel in the thirties to early fifties, such as those he associated more with ‘political Zionism’ rather than Einstein’s self-professed ‘spiritual Zionism’. Einstein’s connection with Judaism was tinged by this very distinction, the one we try to draw today! He loved his people and their customs and traditions, and wanted to secure their safety. But he was also painfully aware of what the homogeneity (a bit reductive, but just for instance) of a society can be used for in the wrong hands (fascism).",

    "body": "Thanks for this. This made me read about Einsteins views. Indeed, Einstein was a Labor Zionist (as opposed to a Revisionist). Until 1947, he opppsed the idea of a Jewish state. His views changed in the letter to Nehru as you quoted.\n\nHe said in a 1938 speech:\n\n&gt; I should much rather see reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of living together in peace than the creation of a Jewish state. My awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists the idea of a Jewish state with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power, no matter how modest. I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustain—especially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our own ranks, against which we have already had to fight strongly, even without a Jewish state. ... If external necessity should after all compel us to assume this burden, let us bear it with tact and patience.\n\nAfter independence, he supported Israel but was critical of the violence that was inflicted to achieve it. (That's a sensible take).\n\n---\n\nEinstein's discourse on Zionism is as a means to right the wrongs done to Jews in Europe and to demand their own homeland as others had. I think it notably lacks mention of the injustices that were to be done and later done to the Palestinians. That's important because those injustices, known globally in retrospect, are the core of the Palestinian issue.\n\nHis statements are not egregious or unexpected. He was neither a decision-maker in the World Zionist Congress / Jewish Agency in Palestine, nor on the ground in Palestine to see the events unfold. He just wanted justice for his people.",

    "body": "&gt;There is no doubt that Zionist leaders were clearly interested in getting more land in the partition. However, they have never stated to conquer the entire Middle East, or Palestine.\n\nThere are many issues with your post but this conclusion you came to is just flat out false, since you brought up Ben Gurion for instance:\n\n\"Does the establishment of a Jewish state \\[in only part of Palestine\\] advance or retard the conversion of this country into a Jewish country? My assumption (which is why I am a fervent proponent of a state, even though it is now linked to partition) is that a Jewish state on only part of the land is not the end but the beginning. This is because this increase in possession is of consequence not only in itself, but because through it we increase our strength, and **every increase in strength helps in the possession of the land as a whole.** The establishment of a state, even if only on a portion of the land, is the maximal reinforcement of our strength at the present time and a powerful boost to our historical endeavors to liberate the entire country.\" \\[9\\]  \n([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937\\_Ben-Gurion\\_letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937_Ben-Gurion_letter))\n\nYou go over a portion of this letter in your post so it's strange you didn't actually examine it in its totality, as you were complaining about others not doing.\n\n...\n\n\"Weizmann and Ben-Gurion pressed for a solution based on partition. Said Weizmann: 'The Jews would be fools not to accept it, even if \\[the land they were allocated\\] were the size of a table cloth.' Both saw partition as a stepping stone to further expansion and the eventual takeover of the whole of Palestine. **'No Zionist can forgo the smallest portion of the Land of Israel,'** Ben-Gurion was quoted as saying.\"  \n([https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr\\_0/page/138/mode/2up?q=stepping+stone](https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr_0/page/138/mode/2up?q=stepping+stone))\n\n...\n\n\"It might be noted that the “boundaries of Zionist aspirations” in Ben Gurion’s “vision” were quite broad, including southern Lebanon, southern Syria, today’s Jordan, all of cis-Jordan, and the Sinai. This was, in fact, one of Ben-Gurion’s constant themes. In internal discussion in 1938, he stated that **“after we become a strong force, as the result of the creation of a state, we shall abolish partition and expand to the whole of Palestine. The state will only be a stage in the realization of Zionism and its task is to prepare the ground for our expansion into the whole of Palestine by a Jewish-Arab agreement. The state will have to preserve order not only by preaching morality but by machine guns, if necessary.”**\n\nThe “agreement” that Ben-Gurion had in mind was to be with King Abdullah of Jordan, who would be induced to cede areas of cis-Jordan under his control, while many of the Arab residents would leave. Earlier, **Ben-Gurion had explained to Arab interlocutors that “our land” included Transjordan, and that it extended from the Sinai to “the source of the Jordan.”** In internal discussion he urged that “we do not suggest now to announce the final aim,” which is “far-reaching,” even more so than the aim of those who were opposing partition. “I am unwilling to abandon the great Jewish vision, the final vision,” he added. This vision, here unspecified in scale, “is an organic, spiritual and ideological component of my Jewishness and my Zionist aspiration,” Ben-Gurion explained.\"  \n([https://archive.org/details/NoamChomskyFatefulTriangleF/page/n287/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/NoamChomskyFatefulTriangleF/page/n287/mode/2up))\n\n...\n\n\"Although the Jewish Agency accepted the partition plan, it did not accept the proposed borders as final and Israel's declaration of independence avoided the mention of any boundaries. A state in part of Palestine was seen as a stage towards a larger state when opportunity allowed. Although the borders were “bad from a military and political point of view,” **Ben Gurion urged fellow Jews to accept the UN Partition Plan, pointing out that arrangements are never final, “not with regard to the regime, not with regard to borders, and not with regard to international agreements.”**\n\nThe idea of partition being a temporary expedient dated back to the Peel Partition proposal of 1937. When the Zionist Congress had rejected partition on the grounds that the Jews had an inalienable right to settle anywhere in Palestine, **Ben Gurion had argued in favour of acceptance: “I see in the realisation of this plan practically the decisive stage in the beginning of full redemption and the most wonderful lever for the gradual conquest of all of Palestine.”**  \n([https://archive.org/details/palestineisraelu0000mcdo/mode/2up?q=full+redemption](https://archive.org/details/palestineisraelu0000mcdo/mode/2up?q=full+redemption))\n\n“After the formation of a large army in the wake of the establishment of the state, we will abolish partition and expand to the whole of Palestine.”  \n— Ben Gurion, p. 22, *The Birth of Israel* (1987), Simha Flapan.\n\n“If it was permissible to move an Arab from the Galilee to Judea, why it is impossible to move an Arab from Hebron to Transjordan, which is much closer? There are vast expanses of land there and we are overcrowded. Even the High Commission agrees to a transfer to Transjordan if we equip the peasants with land and money. If the Peel Commission and the London Government accept, we’ll remove the land problem from the agenda.”",

He also says later in his testimony:\n\nThis is a very misleading reading of Ben Gurion's testimony. Yes, he was not in favor of a bi-national state. But that doesn't mean partition was his favored solution. What he wanted was to establish some sort of trusteeship over the territory, which would allow for large scale Jewish immigration, before establishing a Jewish state in the entirety of Palestine. This was necessary because a democracy could not be established without a Jewish majority.\n\n&gt;CHAIRMAN: On the other hand, we see that you want the abolition of the Mandate and you do not want the substitution of a trusteeship, or something of that kind, for the Mandate. Then the question must come up: how do you think that immigration could be implemented if the Mandate has ceased? What kind of government do you think should be established in this country instead of the Mandate?\n\n&gt;Mr. BEN GURION: Well, that is a very legitimate question, and a very sensible question, and I will try to answer you to the best of my ability. We say that the White Paper policy is illegal, and therefore, it should be removed at once. The Mandate, in fact, does not exist because it was violated by the Mandatory. We are not in favour of renewing it. We do not believe that in the future it will be carried out better than in the past. Therefore, we say that the original intention and the need, and what in our conviction is just, should be decided upon by the United Nations, and a Jewish State should be established.\n\n&gt;There are two parts in the establishment of a state: one is the material part, which is the most essential; the other is the legal part, the purely formal one, which is also of great importance.\n\n&gt;I will say a word about the material establishment, because the whole difficulty of the problem here is that you have a people, you have a country, and their right to the country was acknowledged, but the people do not happen to be there yet. They were dispossessed, and they have to come back. So, the first thing is the material establishment of the state, which means that plans based on our experience and on achievements, examined and approved by experts-economic, irrigation, agricultural, industrial experts, and so on-should be examined by the Committee and the United Nations to see how they can be carried out; and that a million Jews should be resettled in their country.\n\n&gt;In our view it is not only possible, but it is possible to do so by good will. It is possible to do it in a very short time. This is the material establishment of a national home for the Jewish State. This may take some time. In the meantime, it will be supervised by the highest authority of the United Nations. The fact that the Mandatory itself referred it to the United Nations implies a certain recognition that this is the place where it has to be judged and de, decided, although the Mandatory did not undertake formally to carry it out. But there is an indication that this is the place where it should be decided.\n\n&gt;Assuming that on the recommendations of your Committee the United Nations approves of that plan, the material establishment, it means the settlement of the first million Jews I say a million, it may be 900,000 or it may be 1,100,000, to state a round figure-in the shortest possible time. Even the shortest possible time may and must take some time. I am unable to say how long it will take. I think no one is able to say that, because there are always in human affairs unforeseen things which may happen. But it should not take longer, as far as w.e can judge now-it must not take longer than a few years. Not necessarily longer than a few years. Then, in the meantime, a committee, or any instrument which the United Nations will decide on, will supervise.\n\nQuotes continued in comment below",

The question does not arise on the Mandate. But my answer to the question is, you have to decide whether what we ask is right or wrong. If it is right, and force is necessary, you have to apply it. If it is wrong, not only you do not have to apply force, but you do not have to allow it. It is a question of right and wrong, and not whether to apply or not to apply force, as in any other conflict in the world. And this is the reason the United Nations was established.\n\n&gt;Mr. RAND   (Canada):  I suppose that is one case in which you can resort to absolutes.\n\n&gt;Mr. BEN GURION: No absolutes. This was the reason why we were ready in 1937 I mean the majority-to consider a compromise. **Although we knew we were entitled to an entire country, when the British Government came and told us the result of that Commission, they said, you are right, but this will require force and we do not want it and we cannot do it, and therefore we tell you here is a compromise.

Even before Oct 7th there were issues with the supply of different contraceptives due to restrictions at the border. A lot of of commonly used contraceptives are either not available, expired (OCPs), too expensive (IUDs), or repurposed (to take place of other medical supplies that are unavailable/ low supply)\n\n- For cultural beliefs contraceptive use didn't seem related to religious beliefs.\n\n&gt; Religious beliefs, particularly those grounded in Islamic doctrine, do not appear to directly influence the decision whether to use or abstain from using family planning services among most residents of Gaza. Furthermore, Islamic teachings do not appear to directly dictate an individual’s decision regarding their desired number of children.\n\n\n- Based on demographics: higher education and better financial status is associated with higher likelihood of using family planning services.",

This all pisses you off because on one hand tou are being actively wiped out by the oppressor and on another they are trying to halt your reproduction.

Condoms are actually a good one because many people are actually not aware of how to properly store condoms, how to properly apply, how to tell if the condom breaks and what to do if it does. But condoms, if used perfectly, has a 98% success rate for pregnancy and an effective rate of 85-87% because of the above issues. That means that out of 100 people all using condoms you can expect every year 15-17 of them will have a baby.

It's true, they're still pumping 'em out far above the international average, but we must remember that this average is falling both the world over and of course within Palestinian society within and outside the territories. For Palestinians within Israel and the territories the fertility rate used to be around 9, which was an \\*eye-watering\\* number. The immediate diaspora was probably similar, given their rate of growth. Still, it's down to either half that or in some cases approaching a more a \"western\" rate, depending on where you look and who you look at. \n\nNow, we don't really have the data necessary to make an accurate assessment of how the present stage of the conflict will affect fertility rates either now (reported births are reportedly down 41%, but \"recorded births\" is the operative phrase here) or within the next few years. However, we can make some ballpark speculation and assume it'll probably go up. Access to healthcare was a \\*big\\* reason for the global drop in fertility over the 20th century, since it upended one of the main reasons for pumping out kids, which was general childhood mortality. Well, the healthcare system is in ruins and will probably remain so for at least a few years. And the natural human response to increased childhood mortality, as we've seen the world over, is really just \"keep on pumpin' \". Y'know, roll the dice, if you make more well then at least a couple of em might make it to adulthood. That'll probably lead to a brief explosion in fertility if healthcare is rebuilt rapidly, as was the case with the 20th century expansion of healthcare infrastructure, which should of course occur for moral reasons but even so one must acknowledge what can also occur alongside.",

In it, she asked her followers for recommendations for bagels in New York, specifying, “I don’t want to be giving any of my money to genocidal maniacs,” and adding that she was looking for shops that are either “actively pro-Palestinian” or “known to not be in support of that hell-hole place and Zionism” – clearly seeking to avoid Jewish-owned stores.\"\n\n\"On October 17, 2023, in response to an explosion outside the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, Save the Children’s Country Director for the West Bank and Gaza Jason Lee said stated, “Our worst fears are being realized. We’re seeing schools and hospitals – places of safety and sanctuary – being targeted. Civilian infrastructure like hospitals and schools must be protected at all times.” Lee ignored the videos, images, and intelligence materials demonstrating that an Islamic Jihad rocket had “misfired” (i.e. detonated in Gaza instead of Israel) and hit the hospital parking lot.\"\n\n\"In October 2020, Save the Children published a report on “the impact of the Israeli military detention system on Palestinian children.” Save the Children itself acknowledged that the data presented in the publication “is not a statistically significant or representative sample. As the report intentionally presents children’s experience from their own perspective, it is also important to note that incidents they mention have not been independently verified by Save the Children”. The report severely downplays the extent and severity of violence committed by Palestinian minors against Israeli civilians and soldiers, and ignores the widespread phenomena of incitement prevalent in the West Bank.\"\n\n\n\"In November 2018, during the violence on the Gaza border, Save the Children stated that “The Israeli government must end the use of sniper fire and live ammunition against children in Gaza. The killing and wounding of children is never acceptable.” Save the Children does not question why these children were present in an obviously violent situation where there was a known potential for injury, nor does the organization condemn Hamas and other Palestinian terror groups’ recruitment and use of children throughout the violence. The NGO also ignored the violent nature of the protests, which have consisted of an organized armed attack on the Israeli border and IDF positions, attempts to destroy and breach the border fence, and sustained arson, rocket, and mortar attacks on Israeli civilian communities.\"\n\n\n\"On May 18, 2018, Save the Children and the Palestinian Center for Democracy and Conflict Resolution sponsored a workshop at the Dar al Huda kindergarten, “Training of Teachers on Positive Discipline in Everyday Teaching.”\nOn May 26, 2018, the Dar al Huda kindergarten in Gaza held a graduation ceremony that included the mock killing and kidnapping of Israelis by children dressed as combatants.1 The simulation included sophisticated equipment such as drones, body cameras, military fatigues, body armor, and sniper camouflage. Children wore headbands representing Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), designated as a terrorist organization by the US, EU, and others.\"\n\n\n\"During the 2014 Gaza conflict, Save the Children published a full-page advertisement in papers throughout the UK of the names of Palestinian children who were killed; a similar list of Israeli children was not produced.\"\n\n\n\"Save the Children has repeatedly joined in the demonization campaign falsely accusing Israel of employing starvation as a method of warfare against Hamas. These allegations have been repeatedly shown to be based on fundamental methodological errors and overwhelmingly disproven by publicly available information.\"",

Attacks occurred at various locations, including shopping centers, public buses, transit stations, cafes, nightclubs, and restaurants, According to a 2006 study from the University of Haifa, only a few of the bombings targeted military objectives.

It might work but that’s an option you don’t want to do unless you absolutely must. \n\nIran doesn’t have an enemy that actually wants to treat it like the Iranian leadership says it does and that has been a key factor for the revolution to begin in Iran. The Palestinians have no such out because they are intimately familiar with what Israel is actually doing to them and has said they want to do to them. Most people on the pro Israel side see the Iranian citizens as good, human, intelligent people and Israel and the US’s actions in the 12 day war have given people confidence in that statement. Gaza is in a different situation because the Israelis do actually see the Gazans with a lack of humanity and primarily as a threat that has to be dealt with who are primarily evil. \n\nI cannot stress this enough, these protests in Iran aren’t nearly as successful if the Iranian people don’t believe that the Iranian regime is lying to them about their primary foreign adversaries. The Gazans have no hope to change their mind on this matter because they are fundamentally correct about their assumptions about Israel’s opinion of them. \n\nThe Iranian people are forced to choose between the regime and something completely different if possible. The Gazans have to choose between  Israel and Hamas with Israel’s restrictions. Considering Israel’s policies towards the Palestinians until this point and the insistence that the Palestinians can’t all be citizens of Israel, do you see why this option for the Palestinians is dramatically harder to pick than for the Iranians?",

This is the largest reason why Israel rejects the one state solution, it would force them to be willing to grant citizenship to all Palestinians in the region, something they EXPLICITLY are opposed to.\n\nI don’t have a qualification for my claims on how Israelis see Iranians other than what I’ve seen about how Israel discusses the Iranians. For the Palestinians we have the data about how the Israelis don’t see the Palestinians as human\n\n“When asked about the level of humanity of other side, Palestinians gave Jews an average score of 6 out of 100; Jews gave Palestinians an average score of 14. 51% of Jewish Israelis gave Palestinians a score of zero” https://pcpsr.org/en/node/989\n\nThe Palestinians are far worse than the Israelis on this matter, but if the issue is if those who would be revolutionaries believe that the other side sees them as human, then the Iranian public would be correct to say that Israelis see Iranians as people. The Palestinians would be demonstrably and provably correct in saying that Israelis do not see the Palestinians as human. And if we are talking about a revolution possibility, then who other than Israel is going to fill the opportunistic void left by Hamas? It’s going to be Israel since they have the military dominance and can increase their security by doing so. \n\nIsraelis assign more humanity to Palestinians than the Palestinians assign to Israelis. If you are aware of how much humanity Israelis assign to Palestinians, that is grim in every scenario.\n\nWith Russia, the waters are extremely muddy on this front. The Russian government has no shortage of extreme abuses that the people as a military tactic that they employ. The soldiers are not trained in what to do in order to follow IHL or the rules of war. The soldiers are typically the desperate sort who had little choice but to join the meat grinder. Ukraine has managed to get a LOT of soldiers who defect because of the strong asymmetry between the motives of the soldiers and the motives of the Russian government. The Palestinians, Israelis, and Ukrainians are generally fighting for their nations morals and goals. The Russian soldiers are firstly fighting to get out of jail and a paycheck. \n\nI have no clue whatsoever about the Somalian situation other than the actors and the death toll.",

If by \"the situation in Iran\" one means the fall of the Mullah's, unfortunately that seems less and less in the cards at present.\n\n\\*However\\*, it does seem like Iran is going to stay in prolonged economic crisis for a while that will limit its ability to fund groups like Hamas, since of course between allocating money for this sort of thing and allocating it for IRGC paycheques it's sort of an obvious choice. It loses the latter well then now the regime \\*could\\* fall. So, all in all a diminished Hamas can sort of be expected, unless someone decides to now announce to foot the bills.\n\nAs for what changes, well that's difficult to say, since really it's a matter of how things shake out with the interim administration. Apparently, the head of the proposed interim admin has went and said he'd rebuild the place in 7 years and make new Gazan land by just pushing all the rubble into the sea (with bulldozers he doesn't have), \\*very\\* bold claims for a former deputy minister of of Transportation. It's important to note that Hamas used to operate with much less of a budget, but thrived because of the failures of the government it contended against. If the interim admin fares the same, well then people start saying \"man I miss Hamas\" then it's kinda back to square one, albeit in a much-diminished form.

I can assure you that Iranians do not like the US It may come as a surprise but the US has actually overthrown many democratic leaders, even calling Latin America their playground lol. They did the same in Iran in 1953 along with the UK.   2. Never heard this before. Anti-semitism everywhere is concerning and I do think Israel helps to fuel that. By claiming to be some shield against the “savage Arabs and Palestinians” and saying that the country is for Jews and protects them, you act on Jews’ behalf even when they don’t want to be associated with a kid-bombing country.  3. I can’t find this document anywhere just people talking about it. Can you link it? Also, I’m a little skeptical seeing how it mentioned that a commander was killed for being gay when it’s unconfirmed if that story is true. The video you linked is the same story. The people sexually assaulted or raped by Hamas were Israeli hostages, it isn’t some cartel-linked chain of traffickers. That is deplorable and I don’t support Hamas at all. I support resistance and since they are the resistors right now I support the cause but not everything they do. \n\nSidenote: Imagine if all Jews hated Black people during the Holocaust but Black people around the world continued to protest and lobby for intervention to stop the Nazis from murdering the Jews, would you tell those protestors “Oh but if you were in Hungary they would eat you alive”? Obviously not. I can’t find recognize a genocide and say “That’s wrong”, I don’t care what the victims of that genocide thinks of me. It’s prob the stupidest fucking point.",

But I certainly trend further right in discussing the conflict, and I think the way that happens is illustrative to many aspects of the conflict itself.\n\nContextually, the historical positions at various ends of the spectrum have developed and moved (and pushed people) a great deal over time. It was fairly easy to be a classic liberal in favor of world peace and a stable international order, including the 2SS process, in the 1990s. But the peace process got us nowhere, and withdrawal from Gaza got us 20 years of Hamas.\n\nAs for the worst rhetoric, I mean, the same comes from 'your' side, both from the actual Muslims, who are *deeply* right wing, and call openly and proudly for genocide of Jews every time they open their mouths, to their allies on the left, who seem to have little problem un-masking and marching to slogans like 'gas the Jews.'\n\nI don't think Palestinians are fake, but I'm not sure that their identity is special in any way various other ethnic identities in the region or the entire world isn't, that it means they have more rights to not just a state, but all the land they want, in exclusion of other people. Why do they deserve more than the Kurds? Or the Catalonians? And while there is racist Islamophobia, Islamophobia has also clearly become a default go-to shield to excuse the obvious and open horrors of global Islamic society. I can reject both, call a duck a duck, and call the violent, sexist, homophobic, racial-and-religious supremacists extremists in charge of every sharia society across the planet the primitive chuds and threats to the human race that they are.\n\nUltimately, I consider that my movement hasn't been from the left to the right, but from idealist to realist. Going back to Gaza, pulling out got 20 years of increased violence of the worst kinds. Land for peace is disproven. We've now basically reset to square one. At that point, is it logical to try and do the same thing again? Do you expect the outcome to be different the 2nd time around? Or do you admit that the assumptions of the peace process in that era were probably flawed, and you have to look at different more realistic solutions.",

But I can still work from extrapolation and induction in terms of what has been tried, and what the outcomes have been. Gaza proved that peace for Israel next to an armed Palestinian state is impossible (and it was only unofficially armed; the idea that the outcome wouldn't be 10x worse with Iran able to freely ship in weapons without a blockade is... lol). Democratic processes in the Middle East overwhelmingly elect violent jihadists (see not only Gaza, but pre-coup Egypt). It is absolutely part of what the average Muslim wants. So self-ruling, armed, fully sovereign Palestinians? Yeah, not realistic for a policy goal of 'Peace.' \n\nWhat remains isn't really pretty. Occupation in the near term. Puppet governments and heavy external interference in the medium term. Maybe some kind of controlled federal system in the very long term, if the Palestinians can actually start to de-radicalize through those prior eras. That last one is probably 50+ years out.",

All of them are very much against settlers in the West Bank and would bring them into ‘67 borders tomorrow if possible. All of them hate Netanyahu with a passion.\nThe naqba and right of return is more complicated. Most of them have a lot of empathy for individual Palestinians who suffered. They were taught about Deir Yassin as a terrible thing. But most of them also are deeply skeptical that a land where they are not the majority would be safe for them. Zionism is for them in part a deep connection to a historic homeland but mainly a way to be in charge of one’s own political destiny. If the country had not been majority Jewish, the Palestinian leadership at the time made it clear it would have wanted to cut Jewish immigration off. And part of the point is to always have a place that Jews can escape to — and did, even post 1948. So many of them are still for a two state solution for that reason.\nHope that helps.",

Jerusalem, for example, I think needs to be an international city managed by elected officials from all three major religions with a shared vision of preserving what is there and helping give access to religious rites and practices, especially during holy holidays etc.\n\nAnd I guess... for people who lost their land and homes, what happens to them in a world where they can't be permitted back so Jewish people can have control over a land that is theirs? How do we repair what was taken from them? Especially in a way that is fair. How can that repair be made without Palestinians essentially becoming a colony or refugee camp of Israel? Which is what we see today, but in a way that just sows animosity and spite. How can we adjust this so it becomes mutually beneficial, with both sides coming to agreement. \"Yes, we Palestinians will relinquish our homes to you that were taken, but we enter into this covenant that makes us brothers as we share this land that means so much to both of us\" -- what would get them to say that?

The problem is they can't have that anywhere unless they are the majority, and being the majority means a lot of people need to get out of the way.

And how this analogy provides pretty obvious answers to his question, that thinking about Zionist right-wingers in vacuum would not.\n\n Your suggested answer would provide no meaningful information at all. OP is already aware it doesn't represent all Zionists, that's why he explicitly talked about right wing Zionists. The only thing that answer would do, is meaningless virtue signaling on my end. \n\nAs for \"exceptionalism that determines any malicious behavior as a response to something that has been done to them\", and \"its inconceivable for jews to do something bad unprovoked\", I don't see how what I said implies that at all. I didn't even talk about who's the instigator here, I just pointed out we have a set of symmetrical behaviors. And since OP is probably familiar with one, it explains the other as well. Obviously, the inverse argument would be true. But I would note, probably to your great displeasure, that you've just described an incredibly common antizionist position. To the point that even respected antizionists simply can't imagine the Palestinians having any agency whatsoever in this conflict. \n\nUltimately, what's pathological here isn't my reasonable, useful answer, but you being so upset by it. Because it dares to imply that a bad behavior exists on both sides, rather than paint the Jews as exceptional villains, even if it's not the actual main point. Which is an odd feature of antizionists in general. While most hate movements ultimately rely on double standards to make any sense, only the antizionists feel they're entitled to not have their double standards exposed or challenged in any way. Note how you're not saying that my comparison is wrong - you're saying that I'm not allowed to make it. I'm not sure why you assumed that would work.",

I've never encountered any serious Christian Zionist teacher or book claiming that Jews need to gather in Israel so they can all die horribly while Christians get raptured to heaven, and honestly that's such a cartoonish misrepresentation that it makes me wonder where you even got this idea from because it sure wasn't from actually reading what these people believe. The actual theological framework most Christian Zionists work from comes straight out of the Tanakh (books like Zechariah and Ezekiel written by *your* prophets) which prophesy that in the last days Israel will be restored, attacked by nations, and then God will personally intervene to defend them and judge the world based on how they treated the Jewish people, and plenty of Christians also draw on their own scriptures which predict that *Christians* (not Jews) will face severe persecution before Christ returns, so if anything the shoe's on the other foot regarding who's supposedly dying horribly.\n\nYou're also confusing the rapture with the second coming which suggests you don't actually understand the eschatological framework you're critiquing, and not even all Christian Zionists believe in a pre-tribulation rapture anyway so you're attacking a position that isn't even universally held among the group you're criticizing. What's really going on here is that many Christians support Israel for the same reasons other Westerners do (shared democratic values, common threats, cultural affinity) and yes some *also* have theological reasons rooted in believing that God's covenantal promises to the Jewish people still stand, but reducing that to \"they want us all dead so they can go to heaven\" is exactly the kind of bad faith misrepresentation that anti-Zionists use to drive wedges between Israel and one of its most reliable support bases. You can disagree with Christian eschatology all you want but at least represent what people actually believe before you call them creepy, because right now you're essentially repeating talking points designed by people who want to isolate Israel by convincing Jews that their Christian allies are secretly hoping for their destruction, which is both factually wrong and strategically foolish.",

Other questions are generalizations based on fair arguments. I'm not sure what the analogy for \"Zionist is a slur\" - that Islam has bad rep? Let's try to answer your Q's:\n\n&gt;palestinians are squatters on jewish land\n\nSaid by those who believe the land is Jewish either because it used to be ruled by Jews (historical precedence) or the providence of God to the Jews (religious doctrine). The former is fallacy (right by might and the Jews lost), and the latter is stupid - unless you're religious, in which case you just believe whatever you want.\n\n&gt;palestinians are arabs from arabia, jordan, and egypt\n\nIt's an ignorant take - the Arab conquest Arabized the locals, it didn't replace them with Arabs. I think it doesn't matter because the Arabs that are in Palestine today are Palestinians enough, for all intents and purposes. But it wasn't always the case.\n\n&gt;palestinians are a fake people\n\nProbably rooted in the Palestinian nationality being a recent concept. The first *Palestinian* Arab congress took place in 1919. The local elites defined their \"Palestinian\" identity thusly:\n\n&gt; We consider Palestine nothing but part of Arab Syria, and it has never been separated from it at any stage. We are tied to it by national, religious, linguistic, moral, economic, and geographic bounds\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Syria\n\nIdentities evolve and so do national identities. It took decades past this point for the modern Palestinian identity to coalesce, and I believe it wouldn't have become distinguishable from Syrian or Pan-Arab identity had it not been for the Jews emerging as a local sovereignty, while the rest of the Arabs were defeated in claiming the land and its inhabitants for themselves.\n\nI'll remind you that, in the decades following Israel's creation, Egypt, Jordan and Syria invaded Palestine to claim it for themselves, not to \"free the Palestinians\".\n\n&gt;\"muslim behavior is the reason for islamophobia\"\n\nA generalization ignoring bigotry and racism. But let's look at some dry statistics:\n\n\\- All Arab states are dictatorships\n\n\\- Islam is the dominant religion in the world's most violent countries\n\n\\- Islam is the dominant religion in global terrorism\n\nCombine these 3 with Islam's expansionist doctrine and natural demographics, and you've got a good reason to fear Islam.\n\n&gt;\"why should palestinians get western treatment when they behave like animals\"\n\nThis is a bit of a generalization, and I don't know about \"animals\", but *collectively*, Palestinians do not adhere to Western values.

I think you need to check Ayn Rand and why any right that is contingent on another person providing it as your slave is not an actual right. If USA and Israel are the only countries who voted against this, then it's truly sad, and socialism won. \n\n\nTo answer your question though Israel voted because US voted. Israel votes with US because that's the special relationship and Israel is an ally of the US. Of course then the \"woke right\" asks why Israel is an ally. This is why. Israel votes automatically with US in every UN resolution and in returns *hopes* (with no guarantees at all) that US vetos anti Israel resolutions (on the UNSC). Unfortunate that Israel did not develop more relationships with other veto countries although before the Ukraine war it made great progress with Russia. And there is potential with China but it's blocked by the US. Complicated relationships with France and UK who usually give in to the Arabs.\n\n\nThe support of Israel to the US is the *only* reason why Israel voted like this. Ideologically, and unfortunately in my opinion since I support the Ayn Rand objectivist view, Israel is a very socialist minded country. The \"Left\"  in Israel usually supports this idea of food as a right and the Jewish Orthodox and Muslims in Israel obviously do too... And then you are left with the \"Right\", well surprisingly the Right in Israel is NOT actually capitalist, and the spiritual leader of the secular right was Zeev Zabotinsky (father of the predecessor of the Likud) and he famously declared that not only was food a right but also housing and clothes and education and health.\n\n\n \"Capitalism\" in Israel especially in the last 30 years was driven somewhat by Netanyahu (personally with a few other individuals) and by some forces in the Left and even the more radical Left actually.

Like you say, it is possible for people to not have food without any malice or oppression on the part of others.  It's not a right like freedom of speech, which requires active suppression.  And the concern with codifying it as a right is that it then binds uninvolved parties to fix problems out of their control.\n\nUp until recently, most of the burden of providing humanitarian aid has fallen on the United States and so it's easy for other countries who don't expect to have to fill the gaps to vote on a resolution that sounds good, but wouldn't obligate them to intervention.\n\n  \nHere's the official statement from the US: https://geneva.usmission.gov/2017/03/24/u-s-explanation-of-vote-on-the-right-to-food/.  Much of it talks about specific language in the resolution, but it ends with this: \"Furthermore, we reiterate that states are responsible for implementing their human rights obligations.  This is true of all obligations that a state has assumed, regardless of external factors, including, for example, the availability of technical and other assistance.\n\nWe also do not accept any reading of this resolution or related documents that would suggest that States have particular extraterritorial obligations arising from any concept of a right to food.\n\nLastly, we wish to clarify our understandings with respect to certain language in this resolution.  The United States supports the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living, including food, as recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Domestically, the United States pursues policies that promote access to food, and it is our objective to achieve a world where everyone has adequate access to food, but we do not treat the right to food as an enforceable obligation.  The United States does not recognize any change in the current state of conventional or customary international law regarding rights related to food.  The United States is not a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  Accordingly, we interpret this resolution’s references to the right to food, with respect to States Parties to that covenant, in light of its Article 2(1).  We also construe this resolution’s references to member states’ obligations regarding the right to food as applicable to the extent they have assumed such obligations.\"",

I'm not aware of Israel publishing its reasoning, but they do have a longstanding tradition of voting alongside the USA.\n\nHere is the USA's reason for voting \"no\" as described in the document: \n\n1. The draft did not offer meaningful, concrete steps to solving the problem.\n2. It did not give enough focus on famine often being primarily manmade, the result of conflict. The way to resolve those famines is by ending the conflicts.\n3. It inappropriately discussed trade, which had already been covered in other treaties.\n4. It contained some specific line items with which the USA disagreed. Specifically, on pesticides, on climate change, and on technology transfer.\n5. The responsibility for implementing human rights obligations is on the state, not on the international community.\n\nThey wrap it up with this (emphasis mine):\n\n&gt;**The United States supports the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living, including food**, as recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Domestically, the United States pursues policies that promote access to food, and it is our objective to achieve a world where everyone has adequate access to food, but **we do not treat the right to food as an enforceable obligation.**",

We have to figure out how to deal with them in a rational way. \n\nIf they’re willing to live with us in peace, or are not competent to make a decision about that, we need to do our best to figure out how to live with them in peace, under an arrangement that they like. \n\n\nSo, without having looked at all to fact check this, the top post here is much, much more interesting to me than the Balfour declaration type stuff. \n\nBut it’s not all that relevant to discussions about the future of Palestine and Israel. \n\nIf that information is true, and if Palestinians could be persuaded it was true, maybe that would affect their thinking. \n\nBut, either way, Israel still has to defend itself against attackers, and it still has to find a way to live in peace with Palestinians and other people who say they have claims to the land of Israel or Palestine and are open to living in and around the region in peace. \n\nThe (very interesting) history doesn’t change that.",

We all have a chance to think hard about what we’re writing. We can be fair and kind for free. \n\nAnd we can see that looking mean is self-destructive.\n\nWhen people who think they’re pro-Israel write mean and unattractive things here, that’s more destructive to Jews and Israel than if the enemies of Israel had, say, wrecked an Israeli embassy. \n\nDestroying an embassy might cause $1 million in losses. \n\nA really awful post on Reddit could cause, say, $1,000 in reputation damage per post per undecided or mildly opinionated reader per year and stick in people’s minds for 30 years. So, easily $30 million in damage. \n\nSo, even from the coldest, most selfish perspective: Why are people who believe they’re supporters of Israel being so utterly hostile toward the value of Israel’s reputation? Why do they think equating Israel with nastiness is in any way good for Israel?\n\nIf someone is in an airraid shelter and posting that way: OK.

The concept of Indonesian was a project started by an anti-colonialist political party, Sarekat Islam, who in 1912, promoted the idea that 'Indonesian' was any person living under Dutch colonial rule in the Dutch East Indies (they were initially founded to oppose Chinese traders, but within a year pivoted to Indonesian nationalism). This arcepelego spanning concept of nationality, for a time, competed with the Island based independence movements, that promoted natavist, blood and land, concept of nationality. The more familiar inherited nationality. In the 1920-30s these natavist independence movements disbanded and merged with the arcepelego spanning nationality, both were united in their opposition to Dutch colonial rule. In 1945, shortly after Japanese occupation ended, Indonesian nationalists declared independence, resulting in a conflict between Indonesian nationalists, the Dutch colonial power (and allied countries) and well as an internal struggle, often against communists (a bit of a mess). Over 100,000 people were killed.",
