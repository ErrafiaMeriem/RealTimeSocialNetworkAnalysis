From the very beginning of his Congressional career he encouraged his brother, and later his son, to become lobbyists whose main activity was corruptly selling access to him, which he profited from vicariously &amp; via family \"gifts.\" Biden later wrote the mass incarceration crime bill that put millions of non violent drug offenders behind bars. Some years after that Biden wrote the legislation to prevent people from discharging their credit card debt and most other personal debts through bankruptcy. Then at the end, while fueling a genocide he backed 100%, in an incredible show of selfish narcissism he clung to office while glaringly cognitively diminished by age which all but guaranteed him ushering Trump back into power.\n\nEvery president of my lifetime has been a complete villain, despite what their PR campaigns have tried to refute.

    "body": "&gt; First off, when does a liberation movement become a “terrorist” organization? There’s no single, universally accepted legal definition.\n\nYup, this is correct. I would say most people generally accept the idea that when a state actor commits an act of violence it is legitimate, whereas when a non-state actor commits a similar act of violence it is not legitimate (and is terrorism, instead).\n\nThis is \"value neutral\" in the sense that we might look at some non-state actors as heroic (freedom fighters?) and some state actors as evil or visa-versa.\n\nIt's worth saying that the line between \"state\" and \"non-state\" actors is often extremely thin. The Haganah was a non-state actor until May 15th, 1948 and then it suddenly became a state actor (called the IDF, of course). They were not the first terrorist organization to make the leap into being a legitimate state actor, nor were they the last.\n\n&gt; The underlying problem with the “both sides did it” approach is that it conflates historical context with contemporary morality. Criticizing Hamas today is about actions in the present, not the imperfect past of another group. History informs ethics, but it doesn’t provide carte blanche to excuse ongoing acts of violence. \n\nI generally agree with you on this. I do have one quibble here though.\n\nTo me one of the most disturbing things I see is the rhetoric of pro-Israel supporters who claim that Hamas are \"animals.\" Or that Palestinians don't love their children because Hamas sometimes stores weapons underneath schools. \n\nThe irony is not lost on me that the Haganah *also* stored weapons in schools and yet for whatever reasons pro-Israel people don't think that *they* didn't love their children. Both the Irgun and the Haganah committed horrible atrocities against Palestinian Arab civilians, but Israel has named streets after their leaders -- they aren't regarded as \"non-human animals.\" And so on and so forth.\n\nSo yes, previous acts of terrorism *do not ever justify* future acts of terrorism. But understanding the context can help humanize people. You don't have to *like* Hamas, but you certainly need to recognize that the people who do are in fact humans, just like Israelis.",

I agree that context matters but I want to challenge the underlying premise in which you are framing that message. \n\n1)If context matters when analyzing the Israeli nationalist militias of the 1940s then context matters when analyzing the actions of Hamas or any other group. What I find in Pro Israel discourse is that they are very quick to contextualize the actions of Israel or it's political precursors which include the Israeli nationalist militias of the 40s, but they will turn around and take a very acontextual, manichaean approach to Hamas or Palestinian militant groups. The Israeli nationalist militias saw themselves as fighting a British occupation force in the 40s. And Palestinian militant groups see themselves as fighting an Israeli occupation force. Even Shulamit Aloni a former Cabinet minister in Yitzhak Rabin in her interview on Democracy Now noted parallels between the two. \n\n2)When you say that liberation, terrorism, and legitimacy aren't black and white, yes. That's true. And supporters of Palestinian militant groups make the exact same arguments when it comes to their cause as well. \n\nThe reality is this. The killing of civilians as a tactic should be condemned across the board. I don't care which group is doing it or what cause they are fighting for. However we also need to have consistent, intellectually honest standards. Which is something that many people don't apply.",

You just need to be rational.\n\nThe fact is, that outcome is a direct result of the strategy the Palestinians took instead of agreeing to those generous offers. Convincing the Israelis that ending the occupation in any way, even a \"dictated, stripped down\" one, would only lead to infinitely worse outcomes for the Israelis, both in terms of far worse violence against them, and in PR, diplomatic and legal terms.

So the entire argument about the occupation, and how Israeli offers were supposedly insufficient, is completely irrelevant hogwash.\n\nFinally, note that the final line reveals the fundamental flaw in how you view the conflict. You fundamentally can't assume the Palestinians have any kind of agency in the conflict. Even objectively bad decisions, that led to indisputably bad outcomes, in a completely foreseeable and preventable way, are written off as natural, unavoidable emotional reactions. \n\nIn reality, even people under very harsh forms of oppression, far harsher than the Palestinians, and certainly far harsher than the Palestinian terrorist billionaire leaders who're lounging in fancy hotels in Qatar, were able to operate rationally, and make rational compromises, to achieve the end of their occupations. And ultimately, even the most fanatical of Hamas leaders are rational people, who can pull off very sophisticated, years-long, state-level military operations like Oct 7, rather than just \"go full terrorist\" as some emotional reaction to \"oppression\". They are absolutely capable of making rational decisions. The issue is that their ultimate goals are simply not achievable, and are based on bad fundamental assumptions about Israelis.

I'm being direct, but I do not intend to be rude or combative.\n\nAnti-Zionists have an issue with Zionism. Christian Zionism arguably precedes Jewish Political Zionism, which birthed Israel, by a century, if not more. (Look up Puritanism, Pietism, Millininearism, Dispensationalism, and of course Evangelicalism)\n\n---\n\nRe: 1. This is a strawman argument. Jews have ties to Palestine. Palestinians have ties to Palestine. People with cultural and historic ties to a land can argue they should live in that land. I have no problem with that. I have a problem with how that aim was achieved by the dispossession and disenfranchisement of another people. The ethnic cleansing of 750,000 Palestinians from their homes. And a continued denial of their right to live in the land they have ties to.\n\nRe:2. I fundamentally disagree with your framing. All the way from the second Aliyah in 1904-14, Palestinians were aware that some nation building was taking place. Hence the prominent Christian Arab anti-Zionist publications Falastin and Al-Karmil in 1910s. Furthermore, the Hassan McMahon correspondence of 1915-16 and the Balfour declaration of 1917 upset many Palestinians. Add to that land purchases from absentee landlords, Jewish-only labor in settlements and you have a recipe for resentment.  It is in this context that some Palestinians resorted to violent protests in 1920s. I do not excuse any attacks on civilians, and I readily condemn any such acts. My criticism is in the *systemic*, *premeditated* violence perpetrated by Irgun, Haganah, Stern militias under the comicity of the Jewish Executive on a scale that left 750,000 Palestinians homeless and stateless.\n\nAny argument that justifies vilification of a whole people and excuses their suffering is calling for collective punishment, which is inherently reprehensible. You are doing that with Arabs, and others do that with Jews.",

The Arab Muslims and Turks horrifically mistreated the Jews in their midst for countless centuries BEFORE Zionism\n\nTheir is a very common misconception that comes up when we talk about this subject. Honestly I don't care at all what ethnic background anyone has and I fully respect however they identify. That is how I feel.. But I feel like I need to talk about this because the pro-Palestine / anti-semites keep bringing this up... This is why I am talking about it. That is the only reason...\n\nIt is all very easy to understand once you spot the obvious. In the Arab and Turkish worlds, your ethnic background is considered to come from your father...\n\nSo let's, with a VERY simple example, see how this would play out. The Ottoman Turks preferred European wives. In the culture of the Oghuz Turks this was a non-issue. The ethnicity of the child was considered that of the father...\n\nSo let's look at this and make some VERY simple examples. It is the 11th century. An Oghuz Turkish man, looks and is ethnically 100% Asian and looks Asian... He has a child with a European woman. According to Ottoman and Arab culture, the child is 100% Oghuz Turk and is a full member of this tribe and is culturally a member of this group.\n\nBut GENETICALLY he is ONLY 50% Turkish. He is 50% Turkish and say, 50% Albanian or 50% Italian or whatever. So the son has some other leading position in the tribe or has some important position in the empire. Because the Ottomans PREFERRED European wives, HE gets a European wife, a woman who converted to Islam from say, the Caucuses or wherever. They have a child. Culturally the child is ALSO 100% Oghuz Turkish. But his DNA is NOW 75% European... you get it? Culture is not the same as DNA...",

In a sense, they just wanted their \"right of return.\"\n\nYou can't undo history to make right injustices from the distant past without creating new injustices in the effort. And \"distant past\" is typically a period less than 77 years. In the Bosnian case, it was around 50 years, but I don't think that sets a lower boundary. Really, when most of the people involved in original event are either old or dead, it's time to move on.",

Send your own enforcers with a softer touch; or if that would be politically complicated, give Israel insurance. Say $10M per death, that's about $10B from 7/Oct, plus associated security and other costs.

Palestinians suffer the same \"oppression\" as the Germans did at the end of WWII — being in the middle of losing a war is \"oppressive.\" Germans toward the end of the war had to navigate checkpoints as Russia and the U.S. occupied Germany. They had to deal with a bad economy. You mention terrorism from Pakistan. Have you noticed that there aren't open borders between Pakistan and India? That is in part because that prevents Pakastani terrorists from being able to simply walk into Mumbai and kill people. Israelis do not want Palestinians to walk into Tel Aviv and kill people either.\n\nThe reality is, the solution is for the war to end. Until then, peacetime campaigns like \"free movement between Israel and Palestine\" and \"more startups in Palestine\" or whatever are meaningless. Israel is not going to sacrifice the lives of its own citizens so that Palestinians can have better jobs. Why do you think the checkpoints went up in the first place? Palestinians were stabbing and bombing Israeli civilians, and metal detectors stopped that.\n\nThe reason the war is going on for so long is that the Palestinian goal is to wipe out Israel. Palestinians have to give up that goal to have peace. Not just some of them — the majority of them. They have to start wiping out their own leaders who insist on fighting an endless war to achieve that goal.\n\nOR and possibly more realistically, the larger Muslims world needs to accept that Israel exists and isn't going anywhere, and stop using Palestinians as a pawn to help soothe their humiliation that Jews have a country. They need to offer Palestinians citizenship in their own countries so their constant refugee status can come to an end. They need to make some agreement with Israel to work on the details about how the rest of it will all work for the Palestinians who want to stay in the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nAfter the war ends, the other details can be worked out — economic opportunities and what not.",

Terrorism is the most egregious form of violent crime and is literally a national security issue, violent crime on the other hand can include stuff like murder which is treated under criminal law so very different legally and the impacts are also different.\n\nSettler terrorism is an issue that Israel tries but fails to grapple with, oppression on the other hand has Hamas and it's ilk as the perpetrators not Israel.",

You can look at Africa for example, a lot of problems don't trace back to only wars. Israelis' economic success is not at the expense of Palestinians' ones, and the majority of Israel's exports are services. Of course you can still point out that Israel's security measures come at the expense of Palestinians' daily lives. But it doesn't affect the services (or digital) sector as it does manual labour. Both Israel and the Palestinian territories will never be physical exports powerhouses.\n\nNow what can you do?

It’s a radical Muslim group which seeks to destroy Israel and make all of the land Muslim. The fact that the Israeli policy was to let them even exist as a neighbor and continue attacking for years, shows the mercy of Zionism.

It's important to contextualize all this properly otherwise it's impossible to understand this.\n\nThe vast majority of Arabs in the region have, for nearly a century, maintained the position that they oppose ANY self determination of Jews on any part of their indigenous land. This is not a conflict based on borders. Arabs have maintained an ideological position informed by Islam, and more recently by Nazi ideology that persista in the Arab world. There is a reason why my Iraqi Jewish family was offered compensation by post-war Germany. The Nazis were VERY active in the region, the Palestinian/Arab leadership were their buddies. Just to setup the situation.\n\nJews are a small ethnic minority in the region surrounded by very large, powerful neighbors that have tried to destroy them multiple times to create their own Arab-dominated ethnostates. That is the status quo of the region.\n\nPalestinians today are brazen because these forces (Arab neighbors) will support them until the last Palestinian breathes. When your neighbor has the position \"either you die, or we die trying\", the conversation basically ends. \n\nWhat about the Israeli side? Surely the same rhetoric exists? Israeli leadership has swung between \"we must offer land for peace like we did with Egypt\" to \"we will do nothing. Offer nothing, and not impede settlers, until we have a partner on the other side willing to talk\". \n\nMeanwhile, Palestinian leadership has left their people with nothing. Arafat, who is considered to be one of Palestines greatest heroes, died a multibillionaire and left his people with nothing. Hamas leaders get fat in Qatar, and Fatah are making bank off the status quo. Even if Israel tried to go out of its way to give Palestinians land of their own, there isn't even a partner to negotiate with.

Gaza is almost pacified so give it another year maybe and they'll be completely disarmed. Send in the wheel excavators and they could have the ground scrubbed of unexploded munitions and tunnels in less than another year. Start with a nice flat clean slate and some nice new tents, eliminate the antagonists like the UN and hamas and Gaza, in a generation or so might be ready for an easing of restrictions, who knows, I guess it depends on them if they want to live in peace or not. \n\nGiving up the settlements isn't going to happen, again nothing in it for Israel. Asking Israel to pay reparations is nuts, they didn't start it, speaking of which, the Israeli's are still owed reparations from when they were thrown out of all those Arab nations, and particularly in the West Bank by Jordan and in the Old Trans-Jordon. In the end reparations work out more in favor of Israel than the Arabs in the mandate area. Again, nothing in it for Israel. \n\nMy two cents is that plan would never work. I think a better plan would be for Gaza to voluntarily disarm immediately and peacefully evacuate all areas behind the yellow line as penance for the atrocities of 10/7. Surrender all hamas members to the Israeli army within 30 days or face consequences. \n\nThe West Bank is a whole other can of worms. \n\nAnyway its great that folks are trying to come up with solutions but its got to be equitable and it must take into consideration that Israel has been forced to defend itself from day one and has no reason to lift restrictions. Trust is something you gain over time and so far its been one terrorist act after another so, Israel has no incentive to lift restrictions. \n\nMy two cents   \nCheers.",

So might as well deal with it all at once and dig up the tunnels while your at it.  \nHere's my plan\n\nI'm sure the plan could be improved but the nuts and bolts are there.\n\nIsrael should take the coastline in Gaza, its a huge smuggling risk and if the Gazan's aren't going to willingly disarm then its a must. Say a one mile buffer zone between the water and the Arabs. Two would be better. Extend the Yellow line to the Wadi Gaza and take the coast along the entire strip. That'd pin hamas in a manageable area with no chance of importing any more weapons.\n\nThe order of operations should be something like.\n\n1. Evacuate all civilians south of the Wadi Gaza but within the current yellow line to the north.\n2. Wheel excavators sift and flatten the area within the yellow line south of the Wadi Gaza down to a depth of about 50 meters.\n3. evacuate all civilians north of the Wadi Gaza back to the south and within the existing yellow line except for a new buffer zone along the coast one mile deep.\n4. The new yellow line is moved forward to the Wadi Gaza taking an additional 25% or so of Gaza in reparations for failing to disarm and the atrocities of 10/7.\n5. wheel excavators flatten the area north of the Wadi Gaza.\n6. wheel excavators move on to flatten the remaining areas controlled by Israel behind the yellow line.\n\nResult.  \n7) All of Gaza is now cleared of unexploded munitions and buildings intact or otherwise, all rubble has been removed for recycling and use outside of Gaza. No salvageable building materials should be left within Gaza. Gaza is flat as a pancake ready to rebuild when conditions are met.  \n8) Hamas is now contained in an area of about 30 square miles of flat gravel sifted of any and all building materials and tunnels down to a depth of about 50 meters.  \n9) set up a 28 square mile refugee tent city and a 2 square mile POW camp.  \n10) Review and register all as they come to the aid stations within the new camp and place them accordingly.  \n11) Aid stations and resources should be controlled and operated by the IDF and all recipients certified as legit refugees.  \n12) The cost of clearing Gaza and operating the refugee camp should come out of the Gaza reconstruction fund or UN funds with the IDF being compensated for its participation. No NGOs should be allowed to participate.  \n13) POW camps should be run and funded in accordance with the Geneva Conventions  \n14) No reconstruction should begin until a period of ten years has passed without incident.\n\nIn the end you've created a legit refugee camp devoid of combatants and antagonistic influences and segregated the belligerents in the accordance with the Geneva conventions. Let the peace process begin. In a decade or so, reconstruction could begin as long as the refugees remain peaceful and build some trust with their Israeli neighbors first. \n\nThe problem thus far is that the UN refused to segregate combatants from non combatants and instead, actively supported their employ within the UN, thus subverting the entire goal of peace between the two parties.\n\nIsrael will need to start over with a clean slate in order to re educate the civilian population while incarcerating the radicals in the POW camp. POWs will need to remain incarcerated until deportations arrangements can be made.\n\nEmigration by the refugees should be immediately allowed to anywhere outside of the mandate area.\n\nThe solution is simple, confine the problem to a smaller and smaller areas and limit the risks through proper preparation of the site, which in this case means flattening all of Gaza. Those huge wheel excavators could handle it in no time. Less than a year depending on how many you have. I'd. say a half dozen of the Bagger wheel excavators would do the job in less than a year.\n\nCheers",

Even Egypt is terrified of the Gazans, and other Arab states are also less-than-enamored of them. I don't think Israel's population would ever accept a population inflow like that.

I may be wrong though -- who knows? \n\nYou're trying to achieve a balance of taking-and-giving to make things fair--however, for both sides, most of what you're describing crosses important \"red lines\" that are unacceptable to each party.

And Israeli citizenship is not a booby prize for losing a war with Israel. I do not want former Hamas or PIJ personnel and their families moving into Tel Aviv, or Haifa, or Qiryat Shmoneh.\n\nFurthermore, 80% of West bank settlers live close to the Green line in settlement blocs that can easily be exchanged with Israel. There is no need to relocate all of them. That's an unreasonable ask.\n\nWhat is more, besides E Jerusalem, all of the West Bank remains unannexed. So your distinction between \"unannexed\" and \"annexed\" doesn't make sense.\n\nAdditionally, the Israeli concern with Palestinian statehood now in the West Bank is that such a state without Israeli military presence may be used as a launch pad for attacks against Israel, like South Lebanon and Gaza were used. However, the West Bank is on Jerusalem's municipal border and just a few km from Tel Aviv and Ben Gurion airport, on higher ground. This plan does not address this security risk at all. There are no security guarantees. You demand that Palestine \"demilitarize\", but without the IDF there to ensure that, who is there to enforce it?\n\nNor are there any institutional demands on the Palestinians for statehood. The Palestinian national movement for a century has spent very little of its effort developing effective institutions for statehood. There are no requirements for Palestinians to develop effective state institutions. The current PA is weak and ineffective, and institutions are weak. Without strong state institutions, the Palestinian state is likely to devolve into conflict, which will inevitably used as an excuse to attack Israel, unless this piece is taken seriously.\n\nFinally, there is no demand of Palestinians to give up ideology of opposition to Israel and annihilation of the Jewish state. So long as that is the national ideology of Palestine, the result will be the same. This ideology is not \"radical\" in Palestinian society, but mainstream. Without a plan to deradicalize and actually have Palestinian society accept that Jews are not foreigners and Israel but belong there, and have a right to self determination, then we haven't moved an inch.",

Five independent Arab states have since been established in these territories.Only 1% was reserved for the Jewish people in the land of their origin. The decision which led to the proclamation of the Balfour Declaration was not arbitrary, nor the choice of territory capricious. It took into account the needs and aspirations of both Arab and Jew, and certainly, the lion’s share did not fall to the Jews. In the august scale of justice,which weighs need against need, there is not doubt as to whose is more heavy.  The “small notch” in the land of their fathers, granted the Jewish people, somewhat redresses the balance.”\n\nThis argument fails to address the consequences for the Arabs living in that 1%. Basing decisions like states based on overall land mass is terribly reductive. It is wonderful for Einstein to volunteer the Arab Palestinian land to \"[Redress] the balance\" of the monstrous treatment of Jews **across the globe**. Arabs are the ones expected to abandon their homes, land and uproot their lives to right the wrongs of others. There are plenty of places for Arabs to go so what is the big deal? \n\nJews really want to have a state right here and you know how bad things have been in Europe for them lately. No. We won't let them come here. But...they can go where you live and if you aren't fine with that then you are actually the bad guy. \n\nLand has people on it.\n\nEdit - Repeated myself.",

Note the date. If he could see what it has become he would be rolling over in his grave.      \n\nDec 2, 1948      \nTO THE EDITORS OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:         \n\nAmong the most disturbing political phenomena of our times is the emergence in the newly created state of Israel of the “Freedom Party” (Tnuat Haherut), a political party closely akin in its organization, methods, political philosophy and social appeal to the NotSee and Fascist parties. It was formed out of the membership and following of the former Irgun Zvai Leumi, a terrorist, right-wing, chauvinist organization in Palestine.       \n\nThe current visit of Menachem Begin, leader of this party, to the United States is obviously calculated to give the impression of American support for his party in the coming Israeli elections, and to cement political ties with conservative Zionist elements in the United States. Several Americans of national repute have lent their names to welcome his visit. It is inconceivable that those who oppose fascism throughout the world, if correctly informed as to Mr. Begin’s political record and perspectives, could add their names and support to the movement he represents.        \n\nBefore irreparable damage is done by way of financial contributions, public manifestations in Begin’s behalf, and the creation in Palestine of the impression that a large segment of America supports Fascist elements in Israel, the American public must be informed as to the record and objectives of Mr. Begin and his movement.         \n\nThe public avowals of Begin’s party are no guide whatever to its actual character. Today they speak of freedom, democracy and anti-imperialism, whereas until recently they openly preached the doctrine of the Fascist state. It is in its actions that the terrorist party betrays its real character; from its past actions we can judge what it may be expected to do in the future.       \n\nAttack on Arab Village      \n\nA shocking example was their behavior in the Arab village of Deir Yassin. This village, off the main roads and surrounded by Jewish lands, had taken no part in the war, and had even fought off Arab bands who wanted to use the village as their base. On April 9 (THE NEW YORK TIMES), terrorist bands attacked this peaceful village, which was not a military objective in the fighting, killed most of its inhabitants “240 men, women, and children” and kept a few of them alive to parade as captives through the streets of Jerusalem. Most of the Jewish community was horrified at the deed, and the Jewish Agency sent a telegram of apology to King Abdullah of Trans-Jordan. But the terrorists, far from being ashamed of their act, were proud of this massacre, publicized it widely, and invited all the foreign correspondents present in the country to view the heaped corpses and the general havoc at Deir Yassin.       \n\nThe Deir Yassin incident exemplifies the character and actions of the Freedom Party.       \n\nWithin the Jewish community they have preached an admixture of ultranationalism, religious mysticism, and racial superiority. Like other Fascist parties they have been used to break strikes, and have themselves pressed for the destruction of free trade unions. In their stead they have proposed corporate unions on the Italian Fascist model.      \n\nDuring the last years of sporadic anti-British violence, the IZL and Stern groups inaugurated a reign of terror in the Palestine Jewish community. Teachers were beaten up for speaking against them, adults were shot for not letting their children join them. By gangster methods, beatings, window-smashing, and wide-spread robberies, the terrorists intimidated the population and exacted a heavy tribute.      \n\nThe people of the Freedom Party have had no part in the constructive achievements in Palestine. They have reclaimed no land, built no settlements, and only detracted from the Jewish defense activity. Their much-publicized immigration endeavors were minute, and devoted mainly to bringing in Fascist compatriots.      \n\nDiscrepancies Seen      \n\nThe discrepancies between the bold claims now being made by Begin and his party, and their record of past performance in Palestine bear the imprint of no ordinary political party. This is the unmistakable stamp of a Fascist party for whom terrorism (against Jews, Arabs, and British alike), and misrepresentation are means, and a “Leader State” is the goal.      \n\nIn the light of the foregoing considerations, it is imperative that the truth about Mr. Begin and his movement be made known in this country. It is all the more tragic that the top leadership of American Zionism has refused to campaign against Begin’s efforts, or even to expose to its own constituents the dangers to Israel from support to Begin.     \n\nThe undersigned therefore take this means of publicly presenting a few salient facts concerning Begin and his party; and of urging all concerned not to support this latest manifestation of fascism.       \n\n(signed)\n\nISIDORE ABRAMOWITZ, HANNAH ARENDT, ABRAHAM BRICK, RABBI JESSURUN CARDOZO, ALBERT EINSTEIN, HERMAN EISEN, M.D., HAYIM FINEMAN, M.

My awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists the idea of a Jewish state with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power, no matter how modest. I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustain—especially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our own ranks, against which we have already had to fight strongly, even without a Jewish state. ... If external necessity should after all compel us to assume this burden, let us bear it with tact and patience.\n\nAfter independence, he supported Israel but was critical of the violence that was inflicted to achieve it. (That's a sensible take).\n\n---\n\nEinstein's discourse on Zionism is as a means to right the wrongs done to Jews in Europe and to demand their own homeland as others had. I think it notably lacks mention of the injustices that were to be done and later done to the Palestinians.

However, they have never stated to conquer the entire Middle East, or Palestine.\n\nThere are many issues with your post but this conclusion you came to is just flat out false, since you brought up Ben Gurion for instance:\n\n\"Does the establishment of a Jewish state \\[in only part of Palestine\\] advance or retard the conversion of this country into a Jewish country? My assumption (which is why I am a fervent proponent of a state, even though it is now linked to partition) is that a Jewish state on only part of the land is not the end but the beginning. This is because this increase in possession is of consequence not only in itself, but because through it we increase our strength, and **every increase in strength helps in the possession of the land as a whole.** The establishment of a state, even if only on a portion of the land, is the maximal reinforcement of our strength at the present time and a powerful boost to our historical endeavors to liberate the entire country.\" \\[9\\]  \n([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937\\_Ben-Gurion\\_letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937_Ben-Gurion_letter))\n\nYou go over a portion of this letter in your post so it's strange you didn't actually examine it in its totality, as you were complaining about others not doing.\n\n...\n\n\"Weizmann and Ben-Gurion pressed for a solution based on partition. Said Weizmann: 'The Jews would be fools not to accept it, even if \\[the land they were allocated\\] were the size of a table cloth.' Both saw partition as a stepping stone to further expansion and the eventual takeover of the whole of Palestine. **'No Zionist can forgo the smallest portion of the Land of Israel,'** Ben-Gurion was quoted as saying.\"  \n([https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr\\_0/page/138/mode/2up?q=stepping+stone](https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr_0/page/138/mode/2up?q=stepping+stone))\n\n...\n\n\"It might be noted that the “boundaries of Zionist aspirations” in Ben Gurion’s “vision” were quite broad, including southern Lebanon, southern Syria, today’s Jordan, all of cis-Jordan, and the Sinai. This was, in fact, one of Ben-Gurion’s constant themes. In internal discussion in 1938, he stated that **“after we become a strong force, as the result of the creation of a state, we shall abolish partition and expand to the whole of Palestine. The state will only be a stage in the realization of Zionism and its task is to prepare the ground for our expansion into the whole of Palestine by a Jewish-Arab agreement. The state will have to preserve order not only by preaching morality but by machine guns, if necessary.”**\n\nThe “agreement” that Ben-Gurion had in mind was to be with King Abdullah of Jordan, who would be induced to cede areas of cis-Jordan under his control, while many of the Arab residents would leave. Earlier, **Ben-Gurion had explained to Arab interlocutors that “our land” included Transjordan, and that it extended from the Sinai to “the source of the Jordan.”** In internal discussion he urged that “we do not suggest now to announce the final aim,” which is “far-reaching,” even more so than the aim of those who were opposing partition. “I am unwilling to abandon the great Jewish vision, the final vision,” he added. This vision, here unspecified in scale, “is an organic, spiritual and ideological component of my Jewishness and my Zionist aspiration,” Ben-Gurion explained.\"  \n([https://archive.org/details/NoamChomskyFatefulTriangleF/page/n287/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/NoamChomskyFatefulTriangleF/page/n287/mode/2up))\n\n...\n\n\"Although the Jewish Agency accepted the partition plan, it did not accept the proposed borders as final and Israel's declaration of independence avoided the mention of any boundaries. A state in part of Palestine was seen as a stage towards a larger state when opportunity allowed. Although the borders were “bad from a military and political point of view,” **Ben Gurion urged fellow Jews to accept the UN Partition Plan, pointing out that arrangements are never final, “not with regard to the regime, not with regard to borders, and not with regard to international agreements.”**\n\nThe idea of partition being a temporary expedient dated back to the Peel Partition proposal of 1937. When the Zionist Congress had rejected partition on the grounds that the Jews had an inalienable right to settle anywhere in Palestine, **Ben Gurion had argued in favour of acceptance: “I see in the realisation of this plan practically the decisive stage in the beginning of full redemption and the most wonderful lever for the gradual conquest of all of Palestine.”**  \n([https://archive.org/details/palestineisraelu0000mcdo/mode/2up?q=full+redemption](https://archive.org/details/palestineisraelu0000mcdo/mode/2up?q=full+redemption))\n\n“After the formation of a large army in the wake of the establishment of the state, we will abolish partition and expand to the whole of Palestine.”  \n— Ben Gurion, p. 22, *The Birth of Israel* (1987), Simha Flapan.\n\n“If it was permissible to move an Arab from the Galilee to Judea, why it is impossible to move an Arab from Hebron to Transjordan, which is much closer? There are vast expanses of land there and we are overcrowded. Even the High Commission agrees to a transfer to Transjordan if we equip the peasants with land and money. If the Peel Commission and the London Government accept, we’ll remove the land problem from the agenda.”",

This constitutes the basis for a genuine understanding between us and the Arabs.” \nBen-Gurion at Labor Conference, quoted in Mendes-Flohr, *A Land of Two Peoples: Martin Buber on Jews and Arabs*, University of Chicago Press, 1983, p. 6.\n\nWalter Laqueur writes in *A History of Zionism* (1972) that the idea of population transfer was never Zionist policy and “Ben-Gurion emphatically rejected it, saying that even if Jews were given the right to evict Arabs they would not make use of it” (p. 232). Laqueur has more along these lines on Ben-Gurion and other Zionist leaders in this same chapter I can add to later, as well as other authors. \n\nEdit: See also Anita Shapira on Ben-Gurion’s crucial decision regarding the West Bank in 1948 war (*Ben Gurion: Father of Modern Israel*, Yale University Press, 1971, p. 173). I believe Benny Morris covers that decision in *1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War* (2008) as well on p. 386 (“urging Ben-Gurion to order the conquest of the West Bank”).",

He also says later in his testimony:\n\nThis is a very misleading reading of Ben Gurion's testimony. Yes, he was not in favor of a bi-national state. But that doesn't mean partition was his favored solution. What he wanted was to establish some sort of trusteeship over the territory, which would allow for large scale Jewish immigration, before establishing a Jewish state in the entirety of Palestine. This was necessary because a democracy could not be established without a Jewish majority.\n\n&gt;CHAIRMAN: On the other hand, we see that you want the abolition of the Mandate and you do not want the substitution of a trusteeship, or something of that kind, for the Mandate. Then the question must come up: how do you think that immigration could be implemented if the Mandate has ceased? What kind of government do you think should be established in this country instead of the Mandate?\n\n&gt;Mr. BEN GURION: Well, that is a very legitimate question, and a very sensible question, and I will try to answer you to the best of my ability. We say that the White Paper policy is illegal, and therefore, it should be removed at once. The Mandate, in fact, does not exist because it was violated by the Mandatory. We are not in favour of renewing it. We do not believe that in the future it will be carried out better than in the past. Therefore, we say that the original intention and the need, and what in our conviction is just, should be decided upon by the United Nations, and a Jewish State should be established.\n\n&gt;There are two parts in the establishment of a state: one is the material part, which is the most essential; the other is the legal part, the purely formal one, which is also of great importance.\n\n&gt;I will say a word about the material establishment, because the whole difficulty of the problem here is that you have a people, you have a country, and their right to the country was acknowledged, but the people do not happen to be there yet. They were dispossessed, and they have to come back. So, the first thing is the material establishment of the state, which means that plans based on our experience and on achievements, examined and approved by experts-economic, irrigation, agricultural, industrial experts, and so on-should be examined by the Committee and the United Nations to see how they can be carried out; and that a million Jews should be resettled in their country.\n\n&gt;In our view it is not only possible, but it is possible to do so by good will. It is possible to do it in a very short time. This is the material establishment of a national home for the Jewish State. This may take some time. In the meantime, it will be supervised by the highest authority of the United Nations. The fact that the Mandatory itself referred it to the United Nations implies a certain recognition that this is the place where it has to be judged and de, decided, although the Mandatory did not undertake formally to carry it out. But there is an indication that this is the place where it should be decided.\n\n&gt;Assuming that on the recommendations of your Committee the United Nations approves of that plan, the material establishment, it means the settlement of the first million Jews I say a million, it may be 900,000 or it may be 1,100,000, to state a round figure-in the shortest possible time. Even the shortest possible time may and must take some time. I am unable to say how long it will take. I think no one is able to say that, because there are always in human affairs unforeseen things which may happen. But it should not take longer, as far as w.e can judge now-it must not take longer than a few years. Not necessarily longer than a few years. Then, in the meantime, a committee, or any instrument which the United Nations will decide on, will supervise.\n\nQuotes continued in comment below",

The question does not arise on the Mandate. But my answer to the question is, you have to decide whether what we ask is right or wrong. If it is right, and force is necessary, you have to apply it. If it is wrong, not only you do not have to apply force, but you do not have to allow it. It is a question of right and wrong, and not whether to apply or not to apply force, as in any other conflict in the world.

Here is one that was done between October and November 2024, in Gaza.\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12269202/\n\nA very brief synopsis - honestly, go read the study.\n\n- 517 women gave birth during the study in the 3 hospitals included.\n- 17 were excluded from the study for various reasons\n- women were between 16-46, median age 28\n- more than half had a normal BMI (measure of body weight)\n- the majority had given birth previously \n- approximately 1/3 had complications in pregnancy, like anemia, hypertension or UTI\n- 65% had no complications\n- 90% were delivered \"on time\" (median 39 weeks gestational age) and at a normal birth weight\n- 10% of neonates were delivered at a low birth weight \n- all newborns survived birth, \n- 5% required resuscitation\n- 8.5% were admitted to the NICU\n\nIn general, the women's most significant concerns in pregnancy were around labour and delivery (43%). Some (20%) reported their most significant concern being personal safety. A majority reported food supply/diversity as being inadequate, however only 1% reported \"securing food\" as their most significant concern.\n\nHere is a study measuring food deliveries into Gaza that overlaps with the maternal-infant outcomes study:\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11818336/\n\nI don't know what sources you have been reading and I don't know what they are reporting. But whatever you see or read, GO CHECK THE DATA.",

Condoms are actually a good one because many people are actually not aware of how to properly store condoms, how to properly apply, how to tell if the condom breaks and what to do if it does. But condoms, if used perfectly, has a 98% success rate for pregnancy and an effective rate of 85-87% because of the above issues. That means that out of 100 people all using condoms you can expect every year 15-17 of them will have a baby. Actually it’s probably higher as it obviously can count how many women got pregnant but it does as a zygote or morula or blastocyst and such.

It's true, they're still pumping 'em out far above the international average, but we must remember that this average is falling both the world over and of course within Palestinian society within and outside the territories. For Palestinians within Israel and the territories the fertility rate used to be around 9, which was an \\*eye-watering\\* number. The immediate diaspora was probably similar, given their rate of growth. Still, it's down to either half that or in some cases approaching a more a \"western\" rate, depending on where you look and who you look at. \n\nNow, we don't really have the data necessary to make an accurate assessment of how the present stage of the conflict will affect fertility rates either now (reported births are reportedly down 41%, but \"recorded births\" is the operative phrase here) or within the next few years. However, we can make some ballpark speculation and assume it'll probably go up. Access to healthcare was a \\*big\\* reason for the global drop in fertility over the 20th century, since it upended one of the main reasons for pumping out kids, which was general childhood mortality. Well, the healthcare system is in ruins and will probably remain so for at least a few years. And the natural human response to increased childhood mortality, as we've seen the world over, is really just \"keep on pumpin' \". Y'know, roll the dice, if you make more well then at least a couple of em might make it to adulthood. That'll probably lead to a brief explosion in fertility if healthcare is rebuilt rapidly, as was the case with the 20th century expansion of healthcare infrastructure, which should of course occur for moral reasons but even so one must acknowledge what can also occur alongside.",

In it, she asked her followers for recommendations for bagels in New York, specifying, “I don’t want to be giving any of my money to genocidal maniacs,” and adding that she was looking for shops that are either “actively pro-Palestinian” or “known to not be in support of that hell-hole place and Zionism” – clearly seeking to avoid Jewish-owned stores.\"\n\n\"On October 17, 2023, in response to an explosion outside the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, Save the Children’s Country Director for the West Bank and Gaza Jason Lee said stated, “Our worst fears are being realized. We’re seeing schools and hospitals – places of safety and sanctuary – being targeted. Civilian infrastructure like hospitals and schools must be protected at all times.” Lee ignored the videos, images, and intelligence materials demonstrating that an Islamic Jihad rocket had “misfired” (i.e. detonated in Gaza instead of Israel) and hit the hospital parking lot.\"\n\n\"In October 2020, Save the Children published a report on “the impact of the Israeli military detention system on Palestinian children.” Save the Children itself acknowledged that the data presented in the publication “is not a statistically significant or representative sample. As the report intentionally presents children’s experience from their own perspective, it is also important to note that incidents they mention have not been independently verified by Save the Children”. The report severely downplays the extent and severity of violence committed by Palestinian minors against Israeli civilians and soldiers, and ignores the widespread phenomena of incitement prevalent in the West Bank.\"\n\n\n\"In November 2018, during the violence on the Gaza border, Save the Children stated that “The Israeli government must end the use of sniper fire and live ammunition against children in Gaza. The killing and wounding of children is never acceptable.” Save the Children does not question why these children were present in an obviously violent situation where there was a known potential for injury, nor does the organization condemn Hamas and other Palestinian terror groups’ recruitment and use of children throughout the violence. The NGO also ignored the violent nature of the protests, which have consisted of an organized armed attack on the Israeli border and IDF positions, attempts to destroy and breach the border fence, and sustained arson, rocket, and mortar attacks on Israeli civilian communities.\"\n\n\n\"On May 18, 2018, Save the Children and the Palestinian Center for Democracy and Conflict Resolution sponsored a workshop at the Dar al Huda kindergarten, “Training of Teachers on Positive Discipline in Everyday Teaching.”\nOn May 26, 2018, the Dar al Huda kindergarten in Gaza held a graduation ceremony that included the mock killing and kidnapping of Israelis by children dressed as combatants.1 The simulation included sophisticated equipment such as drones, body cameras, military fatigues, body armor, and sniper camouflage. Children wore headbands representing Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), designated as a terrorist organization by the US, EU, and others.\"\n\n\n\"During the 2014 Gaza conflict, Save the Children published a full-page advertisement in papers throughout the UK of the names of Palestinian children who were killed; a similar list of Israeli children was not produced.\"\n\n\n\"Save the Children has repeatedly joined in the demonization campaign falsely accusing Israel of employing starvation as a method of warfare against Hamas. These allegations have been repeatedly shown to be based on fundamental methodological errors and overwhelmingly disproven by publicly available information.\"",

Attacks occurred at various locations, including shopping centers, public buses, transit stations, cafes, nightclubs, and restaurants, According to a 2006 study from the University of Haifa, only a few of the bombings targeted military objectives.

If there are other good reasons to have the civil war, then that is a separate conversation, but this is a devastating compromise that you can’t put back in the box easily and worse doesn’t actually guarantee the thing you are looking for. This would be like trying to cure a hand infection by cutting off your finger. It might work but that’s an option you don’t want to do unless you absolutely must. \n\nIran doesn’t have an enemy that actually wants to treat it like the Iranian leadership says it does and that has been a key factor for the revolution to begin in Iran. The Palestinians have no such out because they are intimately familiar with what Israel is actually doing to them and has said they want to do to them. Most people on the pro Israel side see the Iranian citizens as good, human, intelligent people and Israel and the US’s actions in the 12 day war have given people confidence in that statement. Gaza is in a different situation because the Israelis do actually see the Gazans with a lack of humanity and primarily as a threat that has to be dealt with who are primarily evil. \n\nI cannot stress this enough, these protests in Iran aren’t nearly as successful if the Iranian people don’t believe that the Iranian regime is lying to them about their primary foreign adversaries. The Gazans have no hope to change their mind on this matter because they are fundamentally correct about their assumptions about Israel’s opinion of them. \n\nThe Iranian people are forced to choose between the regime and something completely different if possible. The Gazans have to choose between  Israel and Hamas with Israel’s restrictions. Considering Israel’s policies towards the Palestinians until this point and the insistence that the Palestinians can’t all be citizens of Israel, do you see why this option for the Palestinians is dramatically harder to pick than for the Iranians?",

If by \"the situation in Iran\" one means the fall of the Mullah's, unfortunately that seems less and less in the cards at present.\n\n\\*However\\*, it does seem like Iran is going to stay in prolonged economic crisis for a while that will limit its ability to fund groups like Hamas, since of course between allocating money for this sort of thing and allocating it for IRGC paycheques it's sort of an obvious choice. It loses the latter well then now the regime \\*could\\* fall. So, all in all a diminished Hamas can sort of be expected, unless someone decides to now announce to foot the bills.\n\nAs for what changes, well that's difficult to say, since really it's a matter of how things shake out with the interim administration. Apparently, the head of the proposed interim admin has went and said he'd rebuild the place in 7 years and make new Gazan land by just pushing all the rubble into the sea (with bulldozers he doesn't have), \\*very\\* bold claims for a former deputy minister of of Transportation. It's important to note that Hamas used to operate with much less of a budget, but thrived because of the failures of the government it contended against. If the interim admin fares the same, well then people start saying \"man I miss Hamas\" then it's kinda back to square one, albeit in a much-diminished form.

I can assure you that Iranians do not like the US It may come as a surprise but the US has actually overthrown many democratic leaders, even calling Latin America their playground lol. They did the same in Iran in 1953 along with the UK.   2. Never heard this before. Anti-semitism everywhere is concerning and I do think Israel helps to fuel that. By claiming to be some shield against the “savage Arabs and Palestinians” and saying that the country is for Jews and protects them, you act on Jews’ behalf even when they don’t want to be associated with a kid-bombing country.  3. I can’t find this document anywhere just people talking about it. Can you link it? Also, I’m a little skeptical seeing how it mentioned that a commander was killed for being gay when it’s unconfirmed if that story is true. The video you linked is the same story. The people sexually assaulted or raped by Hamas were Israeli hostages, it isn’t some cartel-linked chain of traffickers. That is deplorable and I don’t support Hamas at all. I support resistance and since they are the resistors right now I support the cause but not everything they do. \n\nSidenote: Imagine if all Jews hated Black people during the Holocaust but Black people around the world continued to protest and lobby for intervention to stop the Nazis from murdering the Jews, would you tell those protestors “Oh but if you were in Hungary they would eat you alive”? Obviously not. I can’t find recognize a genocide and say “That’s wrong”, I don’t care what the victims of that genocide thinks of me. It’s prob the stupidest fucking point.",

Maori being uninformed with garbage opinions on the IP conflct doesn't change the point I made.\n\n\nThe white kiwis screaming about Palestine while marginalizing the maori are what I'm talking about.\nThey will talk about settler colonialism, and maybe even give lip service to Maori issues. But I don't see them moving off the island, giving their businesses to Maori, or anything else they demand from the Israelie's. No calls for the dissolution of the New Zealand state. But they will stand next to you while they reap all the benefits of exploiting you and colonizing you while screaming at Israelis. It's so ridiculous.\n\nBut, yes, even a minority that is currently being oppressed by white people, can also have terrible opinions on the I/P conflict. ",

Things are changing, Japan does have a well-equipped self defense force and a growing trend to amend the constitution. \n\nEven then, Japan and other neighboring countries will feel better with a US military base in the region to help deter Chinese aggression andmaintain peace in the region.\n\nhttps://asia.nikkei.com/spotlight/trump-administration/iran-crisis-sparks-concern-of-loss-of-us-carrier-coverage-in-asia (English language Newspaper based in Japan) Iran crisis sparks concern of loss of US carrier coverage in Asia.

But I certainly trend further right in discussing the conflict, and I think the way that happens is illustrative to many aspects of the conflict itself.\n\nContextually, the historical positions at various ends of the spectrum have developed and moved (and pushed people) a great deal over time. It was fairly easy to be a classic liberal in favor of world peace and a stable international order, including the 2SS process, in the 1990s. But the peace process got us nowhere, and withdrawal from Gaza got us 20 years of Hamas.\n\nAs for the worst rhetoric, I mean, the same comes from 'your' side, both from the actual Muslims, who are *deeply* right wing, and call openly and proudly for genocide of Jews every time they open their mouths, to their allies on the left, who seem to have little problem un-masking and marching to slogans like 'gas the Jews.'\n\nI don't think Palestinians are fake, but I'm not sure that their identity is special in any way various other ethnic identities in the region or the entire world isn't, that it means they have more rights to not just a state, but all the land they want, in exclusion of other people. Why do they deserve more than the Kurds? Or the Catalonians? And while there is racist Islamophobia, Islamophobia has also clearly become a default go-to shield to excuse the obvious and open horrors of global Islamic society. I can reject both, call a duck a duck, and call the violent, sexist, homophobic, racial-and-religious supremacists extremists in charge of every sharia society across the planet the primitive chuds and threats to the human race that they are.\n\nUltimately, I consider that my movement hasn't been from the left to the right, but from idealist to realist. Going back to Gaza, pulling out got 20 years of increased violence of the worst kinds. Land for peace is disproven. We've now basically reset to square one. At that point, is it logical to try and do the same thing again? Do you expect the outcome to be different the 2nd time around? Or do you admit that the assumptions of the peace process in that era were probably flawed, and you have to look at different more realistic solutions.",

But I can still work from extrapolation and induction in terms of what has been tried, and what the outcomes have been. Gaza proved that peace for Israel next to an armed Palestinian state is impossible (and it was only unofficially armed; the idea that the outcome wouldn't be 10x worse with Iran able to freely ship in weapons without a blockade is... lol). Democratic processes in the Middle East overwhelmingly elect violent jihadists (see not only Gaza, but pre-coup Egypt). It is absolutely part of what the average Muslim wants. So self-ruling, armed, fully sovereign Palestinians? Yeah, not realistic for a policy goal of 'Peace.' \n\nWhat remains isn't really pretty. Occupation in the near term. Puppet governments and heavy external interference in the medium term. Maybe some kind of controlled federal system in the very long term, if the Palestinians can actually start to de-radicalize through those prior eras. That last one is probably 50+ years out.",

I've never encountered any serious Christian Zionist teacher or book claiming that Jews need to gather in Israel so they can all die horribly while Christians get raptured to heaven, and honestly that's such a cartoonish misrepresentation that it makes me wonder where you even got this idea from because it sure wasn't from actually reading what these people believe. The actual theological framework most Christian Zionists work from comes straight out of the Tanakh (books like Zechariah and Ezekiel written by *your* prophets) which prophesy that in the last days Israel will be restored, attacked by nations, and then God will personally intervene to defend them and judge the world based on how they treated the Jewish people, and plenty of Christians also draw on their own scriptures which predict that *Christians* (not Jews) will face severe persecution before Christ returns, so if anything the shoe's on the other foot regarding who's supposedly dying horribly.\n\nYou're also confusing the rapture with the second coming which suggests you don't actually understand the eschatological framework you're critiquing, and not even all Christian Zionists believe in a pre-tribulation rapture anyway so you're attacking a position that isn't even universally held among the group you're criticizing. What's really going on here is that many Christians support Israel for the same reasons other Westerners do (shared democratic values, common threats, cultural affinity) and yes some *also* have theological reasons rooted in believing that God's covenantal promises to the Jewish people still stand, but reducing that to \"they want us all dead so they can go to heaven\" is exactly the kind of bad faith misrepresentation that anti-Zionists use to drive wedges between Israel and one of its most reliable support bases. You can disagree with Christian eschatology all you want but at least represent what people actually believe before you call them creepy, because right now you're essentially repeating talking points designed by people who want to isolate Israel by convincing Jews that their Christian allies are secretly hoping for their destruction, which is both factually wrong and strategically foolish.",

Other questions are generalizations based on fair arguments. I'm not sure what the analogy for \"Zionist is a slur\" - that Islam has bad rep? Let's try to answer your Q's:\n\n&gt;palestinians are squatters on jewish land\n\nSaid by those who believe the land is Jewish either because it used to be ruled by Jews (historical precedence) or the providence of God to the Jews (religious doctrine). The former is fallacy (right by might and the Jews lost), and the latter is stupid - unless you're religious, in which case you just believe whatever you want.\n\n&gt;palestinians are arabs from arabia, jordan, and egypt\n\nIt's an ignorant take - the Arab conquest Arabized the locals, it didn't replace them with Arabs. I think it doesn't matter because the Arabs that are in Palestine today are Palestinians enough, for all intents and purposes. But it wasn't always the case.\n\n&gt;palestinians are a fake people\n\nProbably rooted in the Palestinian nationality being a recent concept. The first *Palestinian* Arab congress took place in 1919. The local elites defined their \"Palestinian\" identity thusly:\n\n&gt; We consider Palestine nothing but part of Arab Syria, and it has never been separated from it at any stage. We are tied to it by national, religious, linguistic, moral, economic, and geographic bounds\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Syria\n\nIdentities evolve and so do national identities. It took decades past this point for the modern Palestinian identity to coalesce, and I believe it wouldn't have become distinguishable from Syrian or Pan-Arab identity had it not been for the Jews emerging as a local sovereignty, while the rest of the Arabs were defeated in claiming the land and its inhabitants for themselves.\n\nI'll remind you that, in the decades following Israel's creation, Egypt, Jordan and Syria invaded Palestine to claim it for themselves, not to \"free the Palestinians\".\n\n&gt;\"muslim behavior is the reason for islamophobia\"\n\nA generalization ignoring bigotry and racism. But let's look at some dry statistics:\n\n\\- All Arab states are dictatorships\n\n\\- Islam is the dominant religion in the world's most violent countries\n\n\\- Islam is the dominant religion in global terrorism\n\nCombine these 3 with Islam's expansionist doctrine and natural demographics, and you've got a good reason to fear Islam.\n\n&gt;\"why should palestinians get western treatment when they behave like animals\"\n\nThis is a bit of a generalization, and I don't know about \"animals\", but *collectively*, Palestinians do not adhere to Western values.

I think you need to check Ayn Rand and why any right that is contingent on another person providing it as your slave is not an actual right. If USA and Israel are the only countries who voted against this, then it's truly sad, and socialism won. \n\n\nTo answer your question though Israel voted because US voted. Israel votes with US because that's the special relationship and Israel is an ally of the US. Of course then the \"woke right\" asks why Israel is an ally. This is why. Israel votes automatically with US in every UN resolution and in returns *hopes* (with no guarantees at all) that US vetos anti Israel resolutions (on the UNSC). Unfortunate that Israel did not develop more relationships with other veto countries although before the Ukraine war it made great progress with Russia. And there is potential with China but it's blocked by the US. Complicated relationships with France and UK who usually give in to the Arabs.\n\n\nThe support of Israel to the US is the *only* reason why Israel voted like this. Ideologically, and unfortunately in my opinion since I support the Ayn Rand objectivist view, Israel is a very socialist minded country. The \"Left\"  in Israel usually supports this idea of food as a right and the Jewish Orthodox and Muslims in Israel obviously do too... And then you are left with the \"Right\", well surprisingly the Right in Israel is NOT actually capitalist, and the spiritual leader of the secular right was Zeev Zabotinsky (father of the predecessor of the Likud) and he famously declared that not only was food a right but also housing and clothes and education and health.\n\n\n \"Capitalism\" in Israel especially in the last 30 years was driven somewhat by Netanyahu (personally with a few other individuals) and by some forces in the Left and even the more radical Left actually. Complicated but Israel politics and Right and Left are not based on economy.",

Like you say, it is possible for people to not have food without any malice or oppression on the part of others.  It's not a right like freedom of speech, which requires active suppression.  And the concern with codifying it as a right is that it then binds uninvolved parties to fix problems out of their control.\n\nUp until recently, most of the burden of providing humanitarian aid has fallen on the United States and so it's easy for other countries who don't expect to have to fill the gaps to vote on a resolution that sounds good, but wouldn't obligate them to intervention.\n\n  \nHere's the official statement from the US: https://geneva.usmission.gov/2017/03/24/u-s-explanation-of-vote-on-the-right-to-food/.  Much of it talks about specific language in the resolution, but it ends with this: \"Furthermore, we reiterate that states are responsible for implementing their human rights obligations.  This is true of all obligations that a state has assumed, regardless of external factors, including, for example, the availability of technical and other assistance.\n\nWe also do not accept any reading of this resolution or related documents that would suggest that States have particular extraterritorial obligations arising from any concept of a right to food.\n\nLastly, we wish to clarify our understandings with respect to certain language in this resolution.  The United States supports the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living, including food, as recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Domestically, the United States pursues policies that promote access to food, and it is our objective to achieve a world where everyone has adequate access to food, but we do not treat the right to food as an enforceable obligation.  The United States does not recognize any change in the current state of conventional or customary international law regarding rights related to food.  The United States is not a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  Accordingly, we interpret this resolution’s references to the right to food, with respect to States Parties to that covenant, in light of its Article 2(1).  We also construe this resolution’s references to member states’ obligations regarding the right to food as applicable to the extent they have assumed such obligations.\"",

I'm not aware of Israel publishing its reasoning, but they do have a longstanding tradition of voting alongside the USA.\n\nHere is the USA's reason for voting \"no\" as described in the document: \n\n1. The draft did not offer meaningful, concrete steps to solving the problem.\n2. It did not give enough focus on famine often being primarily manmade, the result of conflict. The way to resolve those famines is by ending the conflicts.\n3. It inappropriately discussed trade, which had already been covered in other treaties.\n4. It contained some specific line items with which the USA disagreed. Specifically, on pesticides, on climate change, and on technology transfer.\n5. The responsibility for implementing human rights obligations is on the state, not on the international community.\n\nThey wrap it up with this (emphasis mine):\n\n&gt;**The United States supports the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living, including food**, as recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Domestically, the United States pursues policies that promote access to food, and it is our objective to achieve a world where everyone has adequate access to food, but **we do not treat the right to food as an enforceable obligation.**",

This is really interesting. \n\nIf there are living Palestinians doing rotten things: Whatever rotten things they’re doing have to be addressed. I’m not a pacifist. \n\nOn the other hand (and I’m writing here as a religious Zionist): The name Palestine has been around for a long time, and the living people who identify themselves as Palestinian, or as other types of non-Israeli people living in Israel and Palestine, are human beings created in the divine image of G-d, and are mostly our spiritual cousins through Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac. \n\nThey all have the same rights all people have. \n\nIf they haven’t done anything wrong, they have the same rights all innocent people have, even if they hate us. We have to figure out how to deal with them in a rational way. \n\nIf they’re willing to live with us in peace, or are not competent to make a decision about that, we need to do our best to figure out how to live with them in peace, under an arrangement that they like. \n\n\nSo, without having looked at all to fact check this, the top post here is much, much more interesting to me than the Balfour declaration type stuff. \n\nBut it’s not all that relevant to discussions about the future of Palestine and Israel. \n\nIf that information is true, and if Palestinians could be persuaded it was true, maybe that would affect their thinking. \n\nBut, either way, Israel still has to defend itself against attackers, and it still has to find a way to live in peace with Palestinians and other people who say they have claims to the land of Israel or Palestine and are open to living in and around the region in peace. \n\nThe (very interesting) history doesn’t change that.",

We all have a chance to think hard about what we’re writing. We can be fair and kind for free. \n\nAnd we can see that looking mean is self-destructive.\n\nWhen people who think they’re pro-Israel write mean and unattractive things here, that’s more destructive to Jews and Israel than if the enemies of Israel had, say, wrecked an Israeli embassy. \n\nDestroying an embassy might cause $1 million in losses. \n\nA really awful post on Reddit could cause, say, $1,000 in reputation damage per post per undecided or mildly opinionated reader per year and stick in people’s minds for 30 years. So, easily $30 million in damage. \n\nSo, even from the coldest, most selfish perspective: Why are people who believe they’re supporters of Israel being so utterly hostile toward the value of Israel’s reputation? Why do they think equating Israel with nastiness is in any way good for Israel?\n\nIf someone is in an airraid shelter and posting that way: OK.

In post-WW1 period, as Palestinians nationalism really started to gain support, most Arab residents of Palestine wanted to be part of a greater Syria, not an independent Palestine.

Basically, Palestine existed as much the nowadays Russian-engineered and created Donetsk People's Republic.\n\nPalestine only then existed after the Roman Empire wiped out and genocided Kingdom of Israel and that too only as a part of a colonial empire never as an independent state or kingdom. From then on it went through Arab Conquest, Ottoman Empire and then finally the British Empire under it's own British Mandate of Palestine 1917-1948 which is the closest it ever got to a state. Even after that though Egypt and Jordan occupied parts of it, Egypt did Gaza and Jordan the West Bank from 1948-1967 after which Israel won those territories due to victory in the Six Days War 1967. Israel then left 4 settlements in the WB and Gaza in 2005 giving an opportunity for a Palestinian state but even nowadays it is not a state and only the PLO has observer status at the UN regarding Palestine.\n\nPro-Palestinian activism centers around the 2SS or 2 State Solution as one of its points precisely because Palestine is not a state yet otherwise 2SS would have 0 meaning.\n\n**So either pro-Palestinan activism partially has 0 meaning or Palestine is not and was never a state?

    "body": "&gt;Did indonesians start calling themselves indonesian in 1949 just  to undermine someone elses claim to the land?\n\nYes, that's essentially correct. The concept of Indonesian was a project started by an anti-colonialist political party, Sarekat Islam, who in 1912, promoted the idea that 'Indonesian' was any person living under Dutch colonial rule in the Dutch East Indies (they were initially founded to oppose Chinese traders, but within a year pivoted to Indonesian nationalism). This arcepelego spanning concept of nationality, for a time, competed with the Island based independence movements, that promoted natavist, blood and land, concept of nationality. The more familiar inherited nationality. In the 1920-30s these natavist independence movements disbanded and merged with the arcepelego spanning nationality, both were united in their opposition to Dutch colonial rule. In 1945, shortly after Japanese occupation ended, Indonesian nationalists declared independence, resulting in a conflict between Indonesian nationalists, the Dutch colonial power (and allied countries) and well as an internal struggle, often against communists (a bit of a mess). Over 100,000 people were killed.",

And there's no hiding it. Men in power don't care about lives. They care about oil, money and power. Donald Trump is a psychopath who cant be stopped. He has even openly stated the most grotesque things. He invented peace that doesnt exist in palestine and demanded a prize for it. The world is a non-sensical mess and men on power trips have destroyed it.\n\nAlso because the tech bros are pro trump (because of money) there is censorship of a lot of accounts. So im sure there are people less jaded than me who are being vocal. But they are struggling to get seen. Because the media is corrupt. Trump is also checking everyone's social media for the past 5 year if they are to get visas. So there's a massive clamp down on activism. Hes also using brute force on immigrants. So yeah, people are being threatened and brutalised into shutting up \n\nFor me, Palestine specifically is something I have invested my time heavily in understanding and fighting for for about 20 years now and we have always been fighting for it. Its has been a consistent and ongoing hell for the palestian people for decades. There have been hundreds of other atrocities but none as long and continuously oppressive as this in my opinion. \n\nFree Palestine 🇵🇸 ✊️",

One of the core calls of this movement was that EVERYONE and their grandmother need to at all times look at and talk about Gaza and basically nothing else. It was made out to be THE most important humanitarian issue of our time, a litmus test for moral clarity for some and there wasn’t a single white people city in the world, where you wouldn’t find graffiti about Palestine and hating Israel. All of that really does beg the question, what it is that made this topic so much more important and the war so much worse, than for example Ukraine, Sudan, Congo, the Uygurs in China, the Kurds in Syria and turkey, being ethnically cleansed,  etc.. And to be honest, people couldn’t give coherent explanation, that wouldn’t fit the other issues too, or even better, especially regarding personal involvement. Which led to people rightfully asking the question, if the movement wasn’t heavily influenced by antisemites, since one of the core ideas seemed to be the delegitimization and destruction of Israel, as the only way to gain freedom for Palestinians, even over the reality of Hamas and fatah abusing their own people. ",

You’re just proving what we have said to be the main problem all along: most pro Palestine protesters are scarily oblivious to what is going on in swana and it makes them easily manipulated by jihadist propaganda. Iran has been oppressed by the mullah regime for decades now. There have been public executions, media control, policing women’s bodies, forcing Islam onto everyone, etc. since 1978. And just as long, there have been uprisings and do you know why pro Palestinians don’t care? Because the people they got their information about Gaza from, the news networks, organizations and independent reporters that “speak the truth” apart from the “evil western media”, were just as funded by Iran as Hamas and Hezbollah. Who do you think build that “worldwide network” that somehow immediately organized pro Palestine demonstrations on October 8th and started this giant media campaign? Do you think it is a coincidence, that organizations that supposedly collected humanitarian help for Gaza, kept being dismantled and forbidden for actually funneling the literal millions in help directly to Hamas? The main idea was always to discredit Israel, make people forget about October 7th and all the other terror attacks, that clearly show Hamas intent and frame Gaza as this enclave of brave freedom fighters, that have been unfairly imprisoned and not, because their goddamn population declared war on Israel and has become a significant danger to Israeli civilians on every contact. The reason you are not aware that Iran has been oppressed for decades, the reason they don’t get the same support, is that they have no lobby, because they are not Arab and the ones oppressing them are not Jews ore westerners.

Knowing a bunch of IDF soldiers personally, I can tell you the chain of events normally is more like this: \n1. Hamas declares war on Israel by slaughtering 2000 people in one day (by hand and face to face, not through bombs) and abducting over 200 more.\n2. Israel reacts by going into Gaza and trying to destroy Hamas military.\n3. Hamas don’t try to defend Gaza at the borders or in front of the cities like in any other war, to keep the fighting AWAY from their civilian population,(see Ukraine), but employ their soldiers INTO their heavily populated cities, building military infrastructure right within civil infrastructure, while not wearing uniform and therefore being indistinguishable from civilians. (Both war crimes)\n4. Israel tries to navigate the thus created highly chaotic urban warzone, by letting people evacuate, but is shot at from non combat zones from sniper or rocket launcher spots, which nearly always happen to sit on top of homes, hospitals, schools, etc.\n5. Israel bombs the thus created military infrastructure (look at rules for international warfare) to protect their soldiers.\n6. Hamas publishes horrifying videos of the children Israel supposedly killed on purpose, by bombing a house or school, conveniently leaving out step 1-5.\n7. People in the west that have no clue about war zones and their rules start rioting.\n\nNot to say, that the Likud isn’t a party of racist a-holes that need to go down, or that there aren’t racists in the IDF that use their power to torment and unnecessarily kill Palestinian civilians. Or that the slow land grabbing in the West Bank shouldn’t stop. But I highly doubt that ANY of the people protesting even have the hint of an idea, how many of those civilian deaths are actually due to Hamas war tactics, that are specifically designed to get their own people killed as martyrs and their deaths used as war propaganda in the west. A tactic that seems to work, looking at the amount of help money that Hamas related organizations in western countries have already funneled directly to Hamas before they were uncovered. If Hamas was a normal government that fought to protect their citizens and provided shelter in bunkers for the civilians, the numbers of deaths would be a clearer sign of intend. Since that is not the case, the sole number of supposedly civilians dying (which is also provided by Hamas) is not really telling us anything except the tragedy of loss of human lives. But not deliberate “slaughter” by Israelis.",

Their goal is to accomplish that at any cost, even the cost of their own people. \n\nIn fact, we saw this with Hamas, where not only do they not care about the civilians, their own people, but the pain and suffering of the civilians is directly seen as additional legitimacy to their cause. The more deaths, the more they gain legitimacy towards their cause. At the same time, it also helps fuel the victim narrative and propaganda both at home and abroad to be used against the enemy. \n\nMake no mistake, the regime is not remotely bothered by how may of its civilians it killed. For 45 years it has failed at absolutely everything other than creating a magnificent police a control apparatus to remain in power. \n\nThis means, you can bomb, out boots on the ground, even kill leaders, and at the end of the day it won’t matter. At the very top, the leaders and their closest allies don’t suffer from any of it. They have internet, they have money, they can travel, and their families don even live in Iran. \n\nThe only way to beat them is to dismantle the policing mechanism internally that gives the control.

The losses weakened it. The people in Gaza have less support for Hamas in Gaza due to the very reasonable concern that Hamas is using them as human shields. Hamas kost the war. While Hamas became more popular than ever among “progressive” lunatics in western countries, their legitimacy among Gaza is diminished. Plus, they don’t have nearly as much military strength.

Literally every single one of your claims are baseless and has not a single shred of evidence. \n\nIt’s so ironic that you Israelis consistently spam the same “radical Muslims terrorists want to take over” nonsense when Israel is foaming at the mouth expending all of its resources to murder more Muslims. Last time I checked Benjamin Netanyahu consistently pressured the United States to “take out” Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan &amp; Iran. It’s borderline psychotic to persist with these anti-Islam Israeli propaganda talking points when Israel is responsible for more death, evil and chaos than every Muslim country combined. Not a single one of you Zionist in this sub are aware of reality. No amount of propaganda, social media platforms, paid politicians or anything you say or do will shift public opinion.

In 1967 the Egyptians said 10k plus Israeli soldiers had died when the numbers at the time were closer to 200 casualties. \n\nIn the many wars this tactic continued and the claim became laughable; especially after the facts became clearer and the 'estimates' were always reversed and circa 10x+ Arab deaths to Jewish deaths - in wars that Arabs started!! \n\nEven the 1973 War (which the Arabs consider themselves to have 'won') - in it the Israelis were fighting combined forces of millions of soldiers and were outnumbered in tanks maybe 5:1 and machinery by a lot more - yet the final result were casualties far higher on the Arab side, and Israel conquered mass amounts of Arab territory. \n\nSo the Arabs understood that the policy had to change 180:  to now inflate the numbers of Arab victims and claim no Israelis were killed in wars started by again the Arabs. It may sound moronic (and is) but world opinion sucked it up and it has fallen for this new tactic, and sympathy has moved from the start up (post Holocaust) Jewish nation to a poor newly created Palestinian nation supported by the wealth of the oil rich Arab family. \n\nI personally don't think that many Arabs live in the West Bank or Gaza. Google says 15.2m Palestinians in the world - compared to 1948 which said 1.2-1.3m - that is circa a 3.35% yearly increase despite all the wars. Really?! Does that seem reasonable? And consider that they are all still 'refugees' being supported by the UN - apparently 700k left Israel in 1948 and became close to 6m now. It seems that the refugee status is not just inheritable to 5 generations but also expanding to all that feel that they are Palestinians or Arab. But again the world sucks it up and lavishes cash on them.\n\nIn comparison - Jews who are known to have high birth rates have gone from around 11m in 1948 to just under 16m in 2025. \n\nAll the numbers just don't make sense, so using the hospital massacre figures which started at circa 500 and ended at 100 (and 5x false increase and killed by the Arabs not Israelis) -  so 70k which probably includes 20-30k soldiers would leave 40k civilians which could means as low as 8000 civilian death - but who knows!!",

Didn't it consider them as inferior people who should only obey? Even today, Israeli-Palestinian citizens do not have the same rights as Jewish citizens.\n\nOne should admit that Israel wanted to rule and decide over Palestinians who should only obey. Palestinians protested of course, various agreements were made but they were not followed and so the situation for them became worse and worse. So Palestinians took up tougher resistance until it became what it became. Unfortunately. They did not expect it to become what it became. The original purpose of 7/10 was to show Israel that enough is enough and that the world wakes up and starts counting Palestinians among people.\n\nBut chaos ensued and so it became what it became, unfortunately.\n\nNo one was innocent, not Palestinians, but not Israelis either. I don't believe in such propaganda about children being burned, etc. Otherwise I'll start talking about how the IDF burned hundreds of people in Gaza, killed even their own, danced in front of destroyed schools, churches, how Palestinian prisoners are treated in prisons where they often ended up without a legal reason. Etc.\n\nIf I were Israel on 7/10 I would take a serious look at why it happened, would start thinking selflessly, about all people regardless of ethnic origin and actually admit that I could have acted a little differently, not harmed Palestinians as much as I did before. And certainly not killed as many as I did, not devastated all of Gaza either. And not murdered them after agreeing on a ceasefire, but I would follow in this case the 20 points the US has put forward.\n\nNote that I am an outsider and my ethnic origin is only European, not Arab or Jewish.",

    "body": "I appreciate you sharing your perspective as a European observer. It’s a complex situation, but to have a truly balanced conversation, there are several factual and legal points that need to be cleared up regarding the claims you’ve made.\n\nFirst, it is a common misconception that Arab-Israeli citizens (who make up about 21% of the population) have inferior legal status. Under Israeli law, they have full and equal rights: they vote in every election, hold seats in the Knesset (Parliament), and serve as judges on the Supreme Court. In fact, an Arab party was part of the governing coalition recently. While there are certainly socioeconomic disparities and historical tensions - much like minority populations face in Europe - it is inaccurate to say they lack the same rights as Jewish citizens.\n\nRegarding the idea that 10/7 was a protest that turned into ‘chaos’ or that atrocities were ‘propaganda’: multiple international bodies, including the UN and Human Rights Watch, have documented that the attacks involved systematic massacres, torture, sexual violence, and kidnapping. Captured documents and body-cam footage from the attackers themselves showed that the targeting of civilians was not an accident, but a pre-planned objective with specific maps of civilian communities.\n\nYou asked why the division didn’t happen.\nIt’s important to note that Israel has agreed to a two-state solution multiple times, as OP mentioned. Beyond the 1947 partition, Israel made significant offers in the Oslo Accords, Camp David Summits, and the 2008 Olmert Plan, which would have seen the creation of a Palestinian state on nearly all of the West Bank and Gaza. These offers were rejected by Palestinian leadership.\n\nRegarding the US 20-point plan you mentioned- that framework actually requires the complete demilitarization of Gaza and the removal of Hamas from power to ensure safety for both sides. It would require both leaderships to protect their civilians, something Hamas failed to do by using civilian infrastructure for military purposes.\n\nFinally, I’m not sure if you realize that Israel is a self-critical democracy. There is a robust Israeli Left and a massive network of peace activists who continuously advocate for a two-state solution and Palestinian rights. Even in the middle of a war, Israelis protest their own government and hold leaders accountable. This internal democratic pressure is exactly what allows for the possibility of change.",

    "body": "You have quite a one-sided view of the conflict and seem to have accepted only the zionist framing.\n\n&gt;Correct my statements if they are wrong as I am still learning about the war. From what I know, Britain promised the region to the Jews and the Arabs at the same time, of course this will start a war\n\nKinda? Britain committed itself to establish a Jewish national home in Palestine in 1917 with the Balfour Declaration. They also separately promised to support an independent Arab state in exchange for Arab support in defeating the Ottoman Empire. You could say that they are incompatible commitments, and in a way they are, but the important part is the actions that followed. \n\nAfter 1917 Britain worked with the zionist settlers to create quasi-state infrastructure in Palestine for the zionists and brutally suppressed the Palestinian opposition. So you can say they followed through on their commitment made in the Balfour Declaration. On the other hand, they did not follow through on their commitment to an independent Arab state. They secretly agreed with France how the region should be split between them in the Sykes Picot agreement. \n\n&gt;How would that be Israel’s fault for coming back to their ancestral homeland when the owner of the land tells you that you can have it?\n\nWell first because Britain wasn't the 'owner of the land', it was a colonial power. And more importantly because there were already people living there. Settlers coming to a place and demanding the natives leave so they can establish a state is still wrong whether or not the settlers view it as their ancestral homeland.   \n\n\n&gt;Despite this Israel tries to have a 2 state solution 4 different times. Palestine denies it every time and starts wars with Israel. Israel wins every time and Palestine loses land because of it. Again I ask, how does that make Israel the bad guy?\n\nI'm not sure what the 4 times you are referring to, but this is at best a very one sided way of presenting the history. After 1948, you have 750,000 Palestinians who have been ethnically cleansed from their homes who are now stateless. Since then, Israel has prevented them from returning to their homes, and at the same time blocked any moves towards an independent, sovereign and viable Palestinian state. In 1967, Israel invaded and occupied more territory, including the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the latter of which is the centre of Palestinian economic, religious and cultural life. It also fragmented the West Bank into separate areas cut off from each other and surrounded by new Israeli settlements, and cuts off Gaza from the rest of Palestine and the rest of the world more generally. \n\nSo the primary opposition to Israel these days tends to focus on the genocide in Gaza (obviously), and the occupation and oppression of Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. \n\n&gt;In 2005 they give Palestine gaza and what happens? Hamas uses it to build miles of tunnels and send hundreds or thousands of missiles to Israel. \n\nThis is a common misconception. Israel withdrew its settlers and soldiers from Gaza in 2005, but it didn't \"give Palestine Gaza\". It was still in effective control, so was still the occupying power according to international law and the leading international bodies. The leading expert on the political economy of Gaza is Sara Roy of Harvard, and her work showing how Israel deliberately 'de-developed' Gaza's economy during this period is required reading on this topic. \n\n&gt;What would you have done if you were Israel?\n\nThe obvious answer is \"not commit a genocide\", but I will expand on that a little. The key point is to understand the underlying cause and work to address it. Palestinian resistance has come in many forms, but at its heart its a fight against an occupying power who has expelled them from their homeland and rendered them a stateless people at the mercy of Israeli occupation and aggression. The solution is to take the difficult steps necessary to end the occupation and work towards living in peace. End the siege on Gaza and the illegal settlement expansion in the West Bank, and give equal rights and freedoms to Palestinians as Israeli Jews currently enjoy. It's a difficult process and it wouldn't solve everything overnight. But the current playbook is also untenable. It just reproduces a cycle of violence that will end with the extermination or expulsion of one group of people. We desperately need a new approach and new ideas, and that will take bravery and real leaders, not just politicians.",

How do you ensure that this future state isn’t another muslim majority state that tramples on the rights of everyone else?\n\nThe same way you do that everywhere else in the world. By fighting for protections, laws and human rights. My own preferred resolution would be a single binational secular state where every inhabitant had equality under the law regardless of their race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, etc. You could have a specific legislature with representatives from each ethnicity, with any bill that affects a minority requiring a certain level of support from that minority's representatives, a constitution with human rights that requires a supermajority to change, a special legislative function for Jerusalem, etc.  There's a lot of creative ideas of how to achieve it - you look at other examples that have worked, learn from their mistakes, see what unique features Israel and Palestine would have, and fight to make it a reality.\n\n&gt;At the end of the day, Palestinians in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza are not citizens of Israel. At one point they were Jordanian and Egyptian. Long ago they would have been citizens of the Ottoman Empire and later under the rule of the British. The ottomans disbanded and the British left.

But this is an imperfect world and what you describe is a fools errand of a nightmare that would end in an ocean of Jewish blood.\n\nMuch like the OP that's an unbelievably one-sided perspective. The Palestinians were never Egyptian,  even when Egypt occupied Gaza. Arabs aren't a monolith. Also, your description of the Nakba and subsequent wars leaves quite a lot to be desired.  Fundamentally, there's a group of people who are stateless and living under occupation, and that needs to end. You can disagree on whether it should end by way of a one state or a two state solution (though I think at this point, the notion of a viable two state solution is dead and buried), but you can't just pretend that Palestinians will suddenly become Jordanians or Egyptians and give up any claim to their homes.",

It was the league of nations to do with as they saw fit. They immediately gave about 80% of it to the Arabs and held the other 20% or so for the creation of a national Jewish homeland. Which is why the West Bank belongs to Israel once the Arabs abandoned after their failed assault on Israel in 67. \n\nIsrael tried the 3 state solution multiple times, not 2, three states, don't forget Jordan. \n\nGaza is a whole other ball game, oh its the same old song and dance except Israel withdrew according to the Oslo Accords just like they were supposed to but the Arabs kept shooting. 20 years later or so Israel has had enough. Personally I think they should take the costal area and all of Gaza city. Flatten every bit of it with a few big wheel excavators (digs up tunnels at the rate of 250,000 tons of material a day) and make it a park with features named after the victims of the 10/7 atrocities.

Oh the Arab nations want them to be Israel's problem and refuse to allow them to even pass through their nations on the way to whoever will take them. But I won't fall into the trap that Israel is responsible for the failed armies of various acts of Arab aggression, in perpetuity. That's the UN and the surrounding Arab states position, but certainly not mine. \n\nI'd point out that the majority of them are recent Arabized immigrants and as such they don't have any significant ties to the land. They were sent there in both punitive measures for crimes committed in their homelands or were chasing job opportunities from Zionists building a nation. They are predominantly NOT locals. \n\nMost of them today are kids (what else is there to do in Gaza) but those kids are already radicalized and its not Israel's job to deprogram them. Israel has a responsibility towards its own citizens, not toward a hateful group of neighbors on land designated for the creation of a national Jewish homeland who's sole goal is the destruction of Israel. No, the Arabs in the mandate area need to take responsibility, get off the world welfare system (UNWRA) and learn to make something of themselves. They're like petulant teenagers who need to be kicked out on their own. Small wonder none of the Arab states will take them. Look what happened to Lebanon or in the Sinai, Egypt had to send in the military it was so bad. No, Israel is NOT responsible for them and if all of Gaza needs to be flattened in order to dig up all the hidden munitions then so be it. Take it out of the Gaza reconstruction funds. Any good contractor knows that sight prep is a big part of any job. In this case, it just needs to be handled on a larger scale. \n\nFlatten the place end to end, keep the yellow line where it is and give the Arabs in Gaza an ultimatum, disarm or Israel will move forward to; in the North where the Yellow Line should be moved forward to at least the Netzarim Corridor and better yet to the Wadi Gaza and in the South to the Megan Oz Corridor. Requiring the evacuation of all areas behind the Yellow Line and taking an additional 25% of Gaza within the Israeli sphere of control until a complete and verifiable disarming of all enemy weapons from Gaza can be established.   \n  \nSend in the wheel excavators to begin demolitions in earnest. The urgency is that hamas is busy as you read this salvaging explosives from the rubble, 10% or so of munitions are duds and they get a lot if not all of their explosives from duds.   \nTime to clean up. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fwrxocrooidg1.jpeg?width=283&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31fc587e4c5b268102c344c2e7be7ccd7908c93b",

A building built by the Jewish King Herod over the Tombs of the Abraham, Issac, Sarah, Rivkah and Jacob who became Israel. Later turned into a Mosque by the invading Arab armies. \n\nJews were only be allowed to go up to the 7th step as a sign of humiliation and inferiority to the Muslims.. Any Jew that passed the 7th step would be beaten and some even killed. This wasn't in the far past, this was happening until 1967. Only when the Jews defeated the Arabs, for the 1st time in 700 years they could walk past the 7th step.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cEDTMV8X8\n\n.\n\nJews were barred access to the temple mount, the holiest place in Judiasm.. not 3rd or 4th.. The holiest place to Jews thousands of years before Islam was even a thought.. since they could not gain access they prayed at the eastern wall instead.. \n\nArabs/Muslims didn't like the Jews praying there, so they placed a muslim cemetery at the eastern wall, both to stop Jews from praying there and prevent the return of the Jewish messiah who was supposed to enter the city from that side, they even blocked the gate. \n\nIt was only in the 1500's when an earthquake knocked a few buildings over near the western wall the ottomans allowed Jews a small section, about 30 feet wide to pray in, and that didn't last that long either with the Muslim community constantly attacking and killing Jews for praying there..\n\nJews would have to go and pray at time when no-one was there, since Arabs mobs would randomly beat Jews they found there.\n\n. \n\nAl-Qawuqji family.. in particular Fawzi. Fawzi served as a Colonel in the Nazi military. Later escaping to the mandate of Palestine at the end of the war.. His most famed quote \"*The battle between the Arabs and the Jews is a total battle, and the only possibility is the annihilation of every Jew in Palestine and all Arab countries*\".\n\nLater as leader of the ALA during the 1947-48 war, he decided to put his many calls to murder all Jews into actions, and was responsible for what would later be called acts of Genocide. His men had blocked all routes in and out of the Jewish sections of Jerusalem, proceeded to firebomb all food stores in the Jewish area, making sure no food can reach the 140,000+ Jewish civilians/inhabitants. \n\nHe then later ordered Cpt. Madlul Abbas to destroy the only spring/water supply to the Jewish quarter, leaving all the civilians without water or food. He also refused to allow Red Cross access to the blockaded Jewish quarter.  He then also setup snipers to shoot and kill any Jews that they saw walking the streets\n\nAs starvation set in, complaints from the Red cross and UN started to mount as well intentional pressure, eventually forcing King Abdullah to make a truce where international officials and the red cross could access Jerusalem. This was mainly triggeed after images and news of the conditions of the Jews in Jerusalem in the 7 month siege made their way to to international media. After this and several more atrocities made their way to international news, King Abdullah disbanded the ALA.\n\nThe end result of the war was the complete ethnic cleansing of over 140,000 Jews from Jerusalem, Hebron and other west bank towns, that with the previous ethnic cleansing of Jews from Gaza in the 1920's during the Arab riots made the Arabs 100% successful at ethnic cleansing all Jews from territories that they held at the end of the 48 war.\n\n.\n\nThe aftermath.. There were about 35 synagogue inside the walls of Jerusalem, most of them were built underground, because no Jewish synagogue was allowed to be above a Mosque. Eventually the ottomans allowed the Jews to build above the ground, so several larger and above ground ones were built in the mid 1800's.. then after the 48 war..\n\nhttps://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jordan-s-desecration-of-jerualem-1948-1967\n\n*All but one of the 35 synagogues within the Old City were destroyed; those not completely devastated had been used as hen houses and stables filled with dung-heaps, garbage. and carcasses. The revered Jewish graveyard on the Mount of Olives was in complete disarray with thousands of tombstones broken, some of which were used as building materials for roads and latrines. Large areas of the cemetery were leveled to provide a short-cut to a new hotel. Hundreds of Torah scrolls and thousands of holy books were plundered and burned to ashes*\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_of_Olives\n\n*some Arab residents uprooted tombstones and plowed the land in the cemeteries, and an estimated 38,000 tombstones were damaged in total. During this period, a road was paved through the cemetery, in the process destroying graves including those of famous persons. In 1964, the Intercontinental Hotel was built at the summit of the mount. Graves were also demolished for parking lots and a filling station and were used in latrines at a Jordanian Army barracks*\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Jewish_cemetery,_Hebron\n\n*During the Jordanian period (1948–1967), the cemetery was intentionally destroyed and the site was cultivated by Arab residents for growing produce. Around 4,000 tombstones were removed and used for construction purposes*\n\n\n.\n\nDirect quotes from Fawzi al-Qawuqji Memoirs..\n\n\"*These reports also indicated that the fires caused by our bombardment of Jewish installations had burnt down many of their provision stores, that the Jews were in utter despair*\"\n\n\"*the Jewish areas depended entirely on water from the Ras al-Ain position, while the Arabs could use the wells in the old city. I therefore cabled to Captain Madlul Abbas, the Commander of the Hattin Battalion, telling him without delay to cut off the water at the springs, which were in his area.*\"",

Including the most heinous of violations of international law (hostage taking of toddlers, Extermination, Genocide), or their proud, longstanding, primary strategy of either openly indiscriminate attacks, or outright targeting Israeli Jewish civilians, without any attempt to pretend to be targeting lawful targets. Or their a systematic, more or less universal abuse of international law for cover for their illegal military activities (Perfidy, Human Shields), that are the direct, intentional reason for the heavy death toll and destruction on *their own* side. And from an ad bellum perspective, the completely illegal, openly stated goal of conquering the state of Israel and annexing it to Palestine, followed by stripping the Israeli Jews of their inalienable right of self determination at best, and complete destruction of the Israeli Jews at worst.\n\nUnlike Israel, Hamas/PIJ don't even pretend to follow the LOAC or IHL, have no equivalent of the Israeli MAG, military courts, or the IAF legal advisors for every strike, any judicial review of international law violations by Gazan courts (which, to be clear, did exist), or anything else that would even remotely seem like a desire to comply with international law. And if anything, the Hamas government loudly praise and reward the most criminal of behaviors by their members, if they don't simply order it outright, while making slick propaganda videos boasting about their systematic, unquestionable criminality.\n\nFinally, as OP correctly pointed out, the fact any Gazan civilians were killed at all in this particular conflict, and any Gazan homes were destroyed, is a direct result of criminal choices made by Hamas, and forced on the Israelis against their will. The choice to start this war of aggression to begin with, by invading Israel and committing Genocide (or at the very least Extermination, hostage taking, gang-rape-executions etc.) in peaceful Israeli Jewish communities. The choice to illegally place their entire war machine under and inside people's homes, schools, hospitals, mosques and other civilian objects, and while refusing to wear any distinguishing marks while fighting (as opposed to revolting parades of hostages, for example), and generally building their entire defensive strategy on abusing international law and maximizing their own civilian casualties. Finally, they made the choice to not end the war for two years, by refusing to comply with their legal requirement to immediately and unconditionally release all of their hostages, and stand trial of their crimes - or even accept the generous pardon and exile that the Israelis offered them.\n\nAnd of course, the far more nuanced violations of international law by Israel, simply cannot absolve Hamas of their legal responsibilities, both to Israelis and their own population.\n\nThe fact is, from the perspective of international law, this is still very much a \"both sides\" issue - with the Palestinian side being significantly worse, on every imaginable level. OP talked about a \"middle road\", and your attempt to swerve hard into the \"but Israel is bad\" side, is simply not justifiable.",

With essentially no attempt whatsoever to follow international law, nothing that comes even close to the Israeli attempts to do so (however deficient you mind find them). And if anything, the Palestinians have a longstanding strategic policy to completely flaunt any obligations they might have under IHL (and international law period), only taking note of IHL when they intentionally abuse it, and this policy forms the core of their military strategy.  And when talking about the recent Gaza conflict, the Palestinian criminal choices are the main driving force behind the suffering and death inflicted on both Gazans and Israelis. So again, trying to take OP's argument about the \"middle road\", and swerving hard into \"Israel is evil\", *especially* if you justify it with \"no middle road when it comes to legal obligations\", is just not justifiable or \"serious\", on any level.\n\nAs for the second paragraph, what's fundamentally \"unserious\" is your engagement with my argument, or rather, refusal to engage with it. If Hamas didn't start this illegal war of aggression, and didn't illegally enmesh themselves within their civilian population, considerations like the proportionality of strikes on civilian objects wouldn't even come into play. Once the Palestinians did make that set of intentional, fundamental criminal choices, it's not impossible, but certainly much, much harder for Israel to pursue their legitimate war aims legally. And it's basically impossible for them to do so, without people like you simply declaring any attack that \"foreseeably killed civilians\" is automatically disproportional, a war crime, and possibly even equivalent to the widespread and systematic Palestinian practice of intentionally targeting civilians, based on the little skewed information they get from the media.\n\nThat's not a coincidence. That's literally the point. The reason why Hamas invested so much effort and money into their criminal strategy of human shielding and perfidy.  You don't get to ignore that, and wave it off with \"who cares, let's talk about Israeli legal obligations instead\".",

I feel like americans and europians have become so used to peace and co-existance that they just assume they can talk through every conflict. In their minds, the priority order is flipped, because they don't experience any of the danger that comes with trying to extend your hand in peace for the other side to try and cut it off. Well guess what, Russia doesn't care about talking, Putin is going to restore the USSR through peace or war and the new gen of europians are going to find out real soon what war is like. Israel is currently in the future position the europian countries will be. The palestinians and surrounding arab countries have been waging war on israel for decades. It doesn't take too much thinking why Jordan and Egypt aren't getting bombed by israel. Its because they stopped trying to destroy israel/don't have a rogue paramilitary within its border trying to destroy israel. Ive been trying to somehow relay this to westerners for a while now. Yes Israel has some nutcases in charge right now, but they will be gone by the next election by the overwhemlingly unfavorable view of Netanyahu by israelis. Who on the palestinian side is going to replace the martyer and jihad programs and teachings of 0 compromise, take everything or die trying?",

They will point to your bias against israel. Some will literally copy/paste links to what Hamas did in Oct. 7th (I don’t understand why). There is an incredibly defensive, reflexive response that will “paint” you as anti-Israeli and unfair to Israel. Not sure what it gains us… there is a lot of anger, fear, and trauma in Israel, and I am empathetic to that. \n\nA handful of responses will acknowledge your interest in finding a middle-ground for discussion. It’s an exception. \n\nI suppose arguing with Pro-Palestinian supporters would have a similar reflexive and defensive response. I don’t know. I don’t have any question for pro-Palestinian supporters. I have already identified a broad range of opinions in that “group” by speaking with them directly when they are out protesting. I automatically reject any arguments in support of Hamas. \n\nI hope you can find some useful dialog here! It’s elusive. \n\nThe reason I believe you can’t find a middle ground:\n\nSome pro-Palestinian supporters (maybe a majority? Does anyone have statistics?) want to see all the land given back to Palestinians. A non-starter. \n\nMost Israeli’s appear to have given up on peace, and don’t trust Palestinians as a result of Oct. 7th. \nAlso, at least from reading a lot of these responses, there is an assumption that the vast majority of Palestinians (some claim all Arabs) want to see Israeli’s dead, and the state eliminated. I don’t live there and I am unable to interface with Palestinians living there, so I don’t know if that is true.",

From the very beginning of his Congressional career he encouraged his brother, and later his son, to become lobbyists whose main activity was corruptly selling access to him, which he profited from vicariously &amp; via family \"gifts.\" Biden later wrote the mass incarceration crime bill that put millions of non violent drug offenders behind bars. Some years after that Biden wrote the legislation to prevent people from discharging their credit card debt and most other personal debts through bankruptcy. Then at the end, while fueling a genocide he backed 100%, in an incredible show of selfish narcissism he clung to office while glaringly cognitively diminished by age which all but guaranteed him ushering Trump back into power.\n\nEvery president of my lifetime has been a complete villain, despite what their PR campaigns have tried to refute.

By contrast, South Africa's Apartheid system lasted until the early 1990s, the Civil Rights movement in the United States lasted until the 1970s (and the Federal officials responsible for COINTELPRO and other activities were never punished for them), and the United Kingdom... well, there's a reason why 65 countries around the world have annual holidays celebrating their independence from the British.\n\nBut the \"anti-zionists\" will not stop talking about the acts of those long-defunct groups to imply that Israel's current government is worse than Hamas.",

    "body": "&gt; First off, when does a liberation movement become a “terrorist” organization? There’s no single, universally accepted legal definition.\n\nYup, this is correct. I would say most people generally accept the idea that when a state actor commits an act of violence it is legitimate, whereas when a non-state actor commits a similar act of violence it is not legitimate (and is terrorism, instead).\n\nThis is \"value neutral\" in the sense that we might look at some non-state actors as heroic (freedom fighters?) and some state actors as evil or visa-versa.\n\nIt's worth saying that the line between \"state\" and \"non-state\" actors is often extremely thin. The Haganah was a non-state actor until May 15th, 1948 and then it suddenly became a state actor (called the IDF, of course). They were not the first terrorist organization to make the leap into being a legitimate state actor, nor were they the last.\n\n&gt; The underlying problem with the “both sides did it” approach is that it conflates historical context with contemporary morality. Criticizing Hamas today is about actions in the present, not the imperfect past of another group. History informs ethics, but it doesn’t provide carte blanche to excuse ongoing acts of violence. \n\nI generally agree with you on this. I do have one quibble here though.\n\nTo me one of the most disturbing things I see is the rhetoric of pro-Israel supporters who claim that Hamas are \"animals.\" Or that Palestinians don't love their children because Hamas sometimes stores weapons underneath schools. \n\nThe irony is not lost on me that the Haganah *also* stored weapons in schools and yet for whatever reasons pro-Israel people don't think that *they* didn't love their children. Both the Irgun and the Haganah committed horrible atrocities against Palestinian Arab civilians, but Israel has named streets after their leaders -- they aren't regarded as \"non-human animals.\" And so on and so forth.\n\nSo yes, previous acts of terrorism *do not ever justify* future acts of terrorism. But understanding the context can help humanize people. You don't have to *like* Hamas, but you certainly need to recognize that the people who do are in fact humans, just like Israelis.",

I agree that context matters but I want to challenge the underlying premise in which you are framing that message. \n\n1)If context matters when analyzing the Israeli nationalist militias of the 1940s then context matters when analyzing the actions of Hamas or any other group. What I find in Pro Israel discourse is that they are very quick to contextualize the actions of Israel or it's political precursors which include the Israeli nationalist militias of the 40s, but they will turn around and take a very acontextual, manichaean approach to Hamas or Palestinian militant groups. The Israeli nationalist militias saw themselves as fighting a British occupation force in the 40s. And Palestinian militant groups see themselves as fighting an Israeli occupation force. Even Shulamit Aloni a former Cabinet minister in Yitzhak Rabin in her interview on Democracy Now noted parallels between the two. \n\n2)When you say that liberation, terrorism, and legitimacy aren't black and white, yes. That's true. And supporters of Palestinian militant groups make the exact same arguments when it comes to their cause as well. \n\nThe reality is this. The killing of civilians as a tactic should be condemned across the board. I don't care which group is doing it or what cause they are fighting for. However we also need to have consistent, intellectually honest standards. Which is something that many people don't apply.",

So the entire argument about the occupation, and how Israeli offers were supposedly insufficient, is completely irrelevant hogwash.\n\nFinally, note that the final line reveals the fundamental flaw in how you view the conflict. You fundamentally can't assume the Palestinians have any kind of agency in the conflict. Even objectively bad decisions, that led to indisputably bad outcomes, in a completely foreseeable and preventable way, are written off as natural, unavoidable emotional reactions. \n\nIn reality, even people under very harsh forms of oppression, far harsher than the Palestinians, and certainly far harsher than the Palestinian terrorist billionaire leaders who're lounging in fancy hotels in Qatar, were able to operate rationally, and make rational compromises, to achieve the end of their occupations. And ultimately, even the most fanatical of Hamas leaders are rational people, who can pull off very sophisticated, years-long, state-level military operations like Oct 7, rather than just \"go full terrorist\" as some emotional reaction to \"oppression\". They are absolutely capable of making rational decisions. The issue is that their ultimate goals are simply not achievable, and are based on bad fundamental assumptions about Israelis. And they should absolutely be held accountable for choosing those bad goals, over reasonable goals, not encouraged.",

I have studied Jewish history very much, I am very interested in it, and in an honest way.\n\nIt is very obvious, the more you learn, the more you understand modern Jews are incredibly well connected to ancient Jews. In behavior, and even in basic appearance, how they even looked. In fact a lot of genetic contributions since antiquity to the Jewish people actually came from the Romans, which totally corroborates this story. \n\nThere is historians who lived through it and wrote about it, like Tacitus and Josephus, but there is also a very strong archeological record, and not just in this land but also in Rome itself, the Arch of Titus of example. That is not a subtle thing they are literally pulling out the menorah out of the temple. Of course the antizionists like to pretend like none of this happened. \n\nThe Palestinains have no recollection of antiquity. Regardless, of course we are not allowed to debate their antiquity, because it's offensive to do so. We are not allowed to offend. But, they are allowed to insult us at the most basic level, to say we are fake people. But of course if you bring up that Palestinain Arabs pray in a foreign language to a black cube shrine outside of this country, this is of course, offensive. You aren't allowed to say this.

They turned the native people into foreigners and the foreigners into native people, and make even questioning this offensive, even with every piece of evidence is against them. This is amazing.

It is in this context that some Palestinians resorted to violent protests in 1920s. I do not excuse any attacks on civilians, and I readily condemn any such acts. My criticism is in the *systemic*, *premeditated* violence perpetrated by Irgun, Haganah, Stern militias under the comicity of the Jewish Executive on a scale that left 750,000 Palestinians homeless and stateless.\n\nAny argument that justifies vilification of a whole people and excuses their suffering is calling for collective punishment, which is inherently reprehensible.

Period...\n\nMillions of Palestinians and other Arabs (not a majority, a large minority) are ALSO ETHNICALLY European. Not culturally.

The Arab Muslims and Turks horrifically mistreated the Jews in their midst for countless centuries BEFORE Zionism\n\nTheir is a very common misconception that comes up when we talk about this subject. Honestly I don't care at all what ethnic background anyone has and I fully respect however they identify. That is how I feel.. But I feel like I need to talk about this because the pro-Palestine / anti-semites keep bringing this up... This is why I am talking about it. That is the only reason...\n\nIt is all very easy to understand once you spot the obvious. In the Arab and Turkish worlds, your ethnic background is considered to come from your father...\n\nSo let's, with a VERY simple example, see how this would play out. The Ottoman Turks preferred European wives. In the culture of the Oghuz Turks this was a non-issue. The ethnicity of the child was considered that of the father...\n\nSo let's look at this and make some VERY simple examples. It is the 11th century. An Oghuz Turkish man, looks and is ethnically 100% Asian and looks Asian... He has a child with a European woman. According to Ottoman and Arab culture, the child is 100% Oghuz Turk and is a full member of this tribe and is culturally a member of this group.\n\nBut GENETICALLY he is ONLY 50% Turkish. He is 50% Turkish and say, 50% Albanian or 50% Italian or whatever. So the son has some other leading position in the tribe or has some important position in the empire. Because the Ottomans PREFERRED European wives, HE gets a European wife, a woman who converted to Islam from say, the Caucuses or wherever. They have a child. Culturally the child is ALSO 100% Oghuz Turkish. But his DNA is NOW 75% European... you get it? Culture is not the same as DNA...",

Just from that war alone, some cute little story about indigenoussss already makes no sense. \n\nThe matter of whether Palestinians are \"indigenous\" or not is a matter of subjectivity, but it can be related, since the Israeli claim rests on them being the true heirs of the Canaanites.\n\nObviously it's nonsense in the abstract as a justification either way, but in this sense the Palestinians have the *stronger* claim. Consider after all; the Jewish diaspora was scattered to the winds and has been interbreeding with cultures all over the world for centuries.\n\nSo what you have is one set of people who claim continuity based on being the ethnic inheritors of the original inhabitants of the land (genetic drift notwithstanding), and another set of people who also claim continuity based on being the ethnic inheritors of the original inhabitants of the land (but who were conquered and presumably had more cultural drift).\n\nWho then, has right to the land?",

But they’d have to prove they didn’t come from say, Egypt, following the development of the land that Jews brought about starting in the 1800’s.

Palestinians suffer the same \"oppression\" as the Germans did at the end of WWII — being in the middle of losing a war is \"oppressive.\" Germans toward the end of the war had to navigate checkpoints as Russia and the U.S. occupied Germany. They had to deal with a bad economy. You mention terrorism from Pakistan. Have you noticed that there aren't open borders between Pakistan and India? That is in part because that prevents Pakastani terrorists from being able to simply walk into Mumbai and kill people. Israelis do not want Palestinians to walk into Tel Aviv and kill people either.\n\nThe reality is, the solution is for the war to end. Until then, peacetime campaigns like \"free movement between Israel and Palestine\" and \"more startups in Palestine\" or whatever are meaningless. Israel is not going to sacrifice the lives of its own citizens so that Palestinians can have better jobs. Why do you think the checkpoints went up in the first place? Palestinians were stabbing and bombing Israeli civilians, and metal detectors stopped that.\n\nThe reason the war is going on for so long is that the Palestinian goal is to wipe out Israel. Palestinians have to give up that goal to have peace. Not just some of them — the majority of them. They have to start wiping out their own leaders who insist on fighting an endless war to achieve that goal.\n\nOR and possibly more realistically, the larger Muslims world needs to accept that Israel exists and isn't going anywhere, and stop using Palestinians as a pawn to help soothe their humiliation that Jews have a country. They need to offer Palestinians citizenship in their own countries so their constant refugee status can come to an end. They need to make some agreement with Israel to work on the details about how the rest of it will all work for the Palestinians who want to stay in the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nAfter the war ends, the other details can be worked out — economic opportunities and what not.",

Terrorism is the most egregious form of violent crime and is literally a national security issue, violent crime on the other hand can include stuff like murder which is treated under criminal law so very different legally and the impacts are also different.\n\nSettler terrorism is an issue that Israel tries but fails to grapple with, oppression on the other hand has Hamas and it's ilk as the perpetrators not Israel.",

It's important to contextualize all this properly otherwise it's impossible to understand this.\n\nThe vast majority of Arabs in the region have, for nearly a century, maintained the position that they oppose ANY self determination of Jews on any part of their indigenous land. This is not a conflict based on borders. Arabs have maintained an ideological position informed by Islam, and more recently by Nazi ideology that persista in the Arab world. There is a reason why my Iraqi Jewish family was offered compensation by post-war Germany. The Nazis were VERY active in the region, the Palestinian/Arab leadership were their buddies. Just to setup the situation.\n\nJews are a small ethnic minority in the region surrounded by very large, powerful neighbors that have tried to destroy them multiple times to create their own Arab-dominated ethnostates. That is the status quo of the region.\n\nPalestinians today are brazen because these forces (Arab neighbors) will support them until the last Palestinian breathes. When your neighbor has the position \"either you die, or we die trying\", the conversation basically ends. \n\nWhat about the Israeli side? Surely the same rhetoric exists? Israeli leadership has swung between \"we must offer land for peace like we did with Egypt\" to \"we will do nothing. Offer nothing, and not impede settlers, until we have a partner on the other side willing to talk\". \n\nMeanwhile, Palestinian leadership has left their people with nothing. Arafat, who is considered to be one of Palestines greatest heroes, died a multibillionaire and left his people with nothing. Hamas leaders get fat in Qatar, and Fatah are making bank off the status quo. Even if Israel tried to go out of its way to give Palestinians land of their own, there isn't even a partner to negotiate with.

Gaza is almost pacified so give it another year maybe and they'll be completely disarmed. Send in the wheel excavators and they could have the ground scrubbed of unexploded munitions and tunnels in less than another year. Start with a nice flat clean slate and some nice new tents, eliminate the antagonists like the UN and hamas and Gaza, in a generation or so might be ready for an easing of restrictions, who knows, I guess it depends on them if they want to live in peace or not. \n\nGiving up the settlements isn't going to happen, again nothing in it for Israel. Asking Israel to pay reparations is nuts, they didn't start it, speaking of which, the Israeli's are still owed reparations from when they were thrown out of all those Arab nations, and particularly in the West Bank by Jordan and in the Old Trans-Jordon. In the end reparations work out more in favor of Israel than the Arabs in the mandate area. Again, nothing in it for Israel. \n\nMy two cents is that plan would never work. I think a better plan would be for Gaza to voluntarily disarm immediately and peacefully evacuate all areas behind the yellow line as penance for the atrocities of 10/7. Surrender all hamas members to the Israeli army within 30 days or face consequences. \n\nThe West Bank is a whole other can of worms. \n\nAnyway its great that folks are trying to come up with solutions but its got to be equitable and it must take into consideration that Israel has been forced to defend itself from day one and has no reason to lift restrictions. Trust is something you gain over time and so far its been one terrorist act after another so, Israel has no incentive to lift restrictions. \n\nMy two cents   \nCheers.",

So might as well deal with it all at once and dig up the tunnels while your at it.  \nHere's my plan\n\nI'm sure the plan could be improved but the nuts and bolts are there.\n\nIsrael should take the coastline in Gaza, its a huge smuggling risk and if the Gazan's aren't going to willingly disarm then its a must. Say a one mile buffer zone between the water and the Arabs. Two would be better. Extend the Yellow line to the Wadi Gaza and take the coast along the entire strip. That'd pin hamas in a manageable area with no chance of importing any more weapons.\n\nThe order of operations should be something like.\n\n1. Evacuate all civilians south of the Wadi Gaza but within the current yellow line to the north.\n2. Wheel excavators sift and flatten the area within the yellow line south of the Wadi Gaza down to a depth of about 50 meters.\n3. evacuate all civilians north of the Wadi Gaza back to the south and within the existing yellow line except for a new buffer zone along the coast one mile deep.\n4. The new yellow line is moved forward to the Wadi Gaza taking an additional 25% or so of Gaza in reparations for failing to disarm and the atrocities of 10/7.\n5. wheel excavators flatten the area north of the Wadi Gaza.\n6. wheel excavators move on to flatten the remaining areas controlled by Israel behind the yellow line.\n\nResult.  \n7) All of Gaza is now cleared of unexploded munitions and buildings intact or otherwise, all rubble has been removed for recycling and use outside of Gaza. No salvageable building materials should be left within Gaza. Gaza is flat as a pancake ready to rebuild when conditions are met.  \n8) Hamas is now contained in an area of about 30 square miles of flat gravel sifted of any and all building materials and tunnels down to a depth of about 50 meters.  \n9) set up a 28 square mile refugee tent city and a 2 square mile POW camp.  \n10) Review and register all as they come to the aid stations within the new camp and place them accordingly.  \n11) Aid stations and resources should be controlled and operated by the IDF and all recipients certified as legit refugees.  \n12) The cost of clearing Gaza and operating the refugee camp should come out of the Gaza reconstruction fund or UN funds with the IDF being compensated for its participation. No NGOs should be allowed to participate.  \n13) POW camps should be run and funded in accordance with the Geneva Conventions  \n14) No reconstruction should begin until a period of ten years has passed without incident.\n\nIn the end you've created a legit refugee camp devoid of combatants and antagonistic influences and segregated the belligerents in the accordance with the Geneva conventions. Let the peace process begin. In a decade or so, reconstruction could begin as long as the refugees remain peaceful and build some trust with their Israeli neighbors first. \n\nThe problem thus far is that the UN refused to segregate combatants from non combatants and instead, actively supported their employ within the UN, thus subverting the entire goal of peace between the two parties.\n\nIsrael will need to start over with a clean slate in order to re educate the civilian population while incarcerating the radicals in the POW camp. POWs will need to remain incarcerated until deportations arrangements can be made.\n\nEmigration by the refugees should be immediately allowed to anywhere outside of the mandate area.\n\nThe solution is simple, confine the problem to a smaller and smaller areas and limit the risks through proper preparation of the site, which in this case means flattening all of Gaza. Those huge wheel excavators could handle it in no time. Less than a year depending on how many you have. I'd. say a half dozen of the Bagger wheel excavators would do the job in less than a year.\n\nCheers",

And Israeli citizenship is not a booby prize for losing a war with Israel. I do not want former Hamas or PIJ personnel and their families moving into Tel Aviv, or Haifa, or Qiryat Shmoneh.\n\nFurthermore, 80% of West bank settlers live close to the Green line in settlement blocs that can easily be exchanged with Israel. There is no need to relocate all of them. That's an unreasonable ask.\n\nWhat is more, besides E Jerusalem, all of the West Bank remains unannexed. So your distinction between \"unannexed\" and \"annexed\" doesn't make sense.\n\nAdditionally, the Israeli concern with Palestinian statehood now in the West Bank is that such a state without Israeli military presence may be used as a launch pad for attacks against Israel, like South Lebanon and Gaza were used. However, the West Bank is on Jerusalem's municipal border and just a few km from Tel Aviv and Ben Gurion airport, on higher ground. This plan does not address this security risk at all. There are no security guarantees. You demand that Palestine \"demilitarize\", but without the IDF there to ensure that, who is there to enforce it?\n\nNor are there any institutional demands on the Palestinians for statehood. The Palestinian national movement for a century has spent very little of its effort developing effective institutions for statehood. There are no requirements for Palestinians to develop effective state institutions. The current PA is weak and ineffective, and institutions are weak. Without strong state institutions, the Palestinian state is likely to devolve into conflict, which will inevitably used as an excuse to attack Israel, unless this piece is taken seriously.\n\nFinally, there is no demand of Palestinians to give up ideology of opposition to Israel and annihilation of the Jewish state. So long as that is the national ideology of Palestine, the result will be the same. This ideology is not \"radical\" in Palestinian society, but mainstream. Without a plan to deradicalize and actually have Palestinian society accept that Jews are not foreigners and Israel but belong there, and have a right to self determination, then we haven't moved an inch.",

The decision which led to the proclamation of the Balfour Declaration was not arbitrary, nor the choice of territory capricious.

It is wonderful for Einstein to volunteer the Arab Palestinian land to \"[Redress] the balance\" of the monstrous treatment of Jews **across the globe**.

Note the date. If he could see what it has become he would be rolling over in his grave.      \n\nDec 2, 1948      \nTO THE EDITORS OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:         \n\nAmong the most disturbing political phenomena of our times is the emergence in the newly created state of Israel of the “Freedom Party” (Tnuat Haherut), a political party closely akin in its organization, methods, political philosophy and social appeal to the NotSee and Fascist parties. It was formed out of the membership and following of the former Irgun Zvai Leumi, a terrorist, right-wing, chauvinist organization in Palestine.       \n\nThe current visit of Menachem Begin, leader of this party, to the United States is obviously calculated to give the impression of American support for his party in the coming Israeli elections, and to cement political ties with conservative Zionist elements in the United States. Several Americans of national repute have lent their names to welcome his visit. It is inconceivable that those who oppose fascism throughout the world, if correctly informed as to Mr. Begin’s political record and perspectives, could add their names and support to the movement he represents.        \n\nBefore irreparable damage is done by way of financial contributions, public manifestations in Begin’s behalf, and the creation in Palestine of the impression that a large segment of America supports Fascist elements in Israel, the American public must be informed as to the record and objectives of Mr. Begin and his movement.         \n\nThe public avowals of Begin’s party are no guide whatever to its actual character. Today they speak of freedom, democracy and anti-imperialism, whereas until recently they openly preached the doctrine of the Fascist state. It is in its actions that the terrorist party betrays its real character; from its past actions we can judge what it may be expected to do in the future.       \n\nAttack on Arab Village      \n\nA shocking example was their behavior in the Arab village of Deir Yassin. This village, off the main roads and surrounded by Jewish lands, had taken no part in the war, and had even fought off Arab bands who wanted to use the village as their base. On April 9 (THE NEW YORK TIMES), terrorist bands attacked this peaceful village, which was not a military objective in the fighting, killed most of its inhabitants “240 men, women, and children” and kept a few of them alive to parade as captives through the streets of Jerusalem. Most of the Jewish community was horrified at the deed, and the Jewish Agency sent a telegram of apology to King Abdullah of Trans-Jordan. But the terrorists, far from being ashamed of their act, were proud of this massacre, publicized it widely, and invited all the foreign correspondents present in the country to view the heaped corpses and the general havoc at Deir Yassin.       \n\nThe Deir Yassin incident exemplifies the character and actions of the Freedom Party.       \n\nWithin the Jewish community they have preached an admixture of ultranationalism, religious mysticism, and racial superiority. Like other Fascist parties they have been used to break strikes, and have themselves pressed for the destruction of free trade unions. In their stead they have proposed corporate unions on the Italian Fascist model.      \n\nDuring the last years of sporadic anti-British violence, the IZL and Stern groups inaugurated a reign of terror in the Palestine Jewish community. Teachers were beaten up for speaking against them, adults were shot for not letting their children join them. By gangster methods, beatings, window-smashing, and wide-spread robberies, the terrorists intimidated the population and exacted a heavy tribute.      \n\nThe people of the Freedom Party have had no part in the constructive achievements in Palestine. They have reclaimed no land, built no settlements, and only detracted from the Jewish defense activity. Their much-publicized immigration endeavors were minute, and devoted mainly to bringing in Fascist compatriots.      \n\nDiscrepancies Seen      \n\nThe discrepancies between the bold claims now being made by Begin and his party, and their record of past performance in Palestine bear the imprint of no ordinary political party. This is the unmistakable stamp of a Fascist party for whom terrorism (against Jews, Arabs, and British alike), and misrepresentation are means, and a “Leader State” is the goal.      \n\nIn the light of the foregoing considerations, it is imperative that the truth about Mr. Begin and his movement be made known in this country. It is all the more tragic that the top leadership of American Zionism has refused to campaign against Begin’s efforts, or even to expose to its own constituents the dangers to Israel from support to Begin.     \n\nThe undersigned therefore take this means of publicly presenting a few salient facts concerning Begin and his party; and of urging all concerned not to support this latest manifestation of fascism.       \n\n(signed)\n\nISIDORE ABRAMOWITZ, HANNAH ARENDT, ABRAHAM BRICK, RABBI JESSURUN CARDOZO, ALBERT EINSTEIN, HERMAN EISEN, M.D., HAYIM FINEMAN, M.

    "body": "Thanks for this. This made me read about Einsteins views. Indeed, Einstein was a Labor Zionist (as opposed to a Revisionist). Until 1947, he opppsed the idea of a Jewish state. His views changed in the letter to Nehru as you quoted.\n\nHe said in a 1938 speech:\n\n&gt; I should much rather see reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of living together in peace than the creation of a Jewish state. My awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists the idea of a Jewish state with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power, no matter how modest. I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustain—especially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our own ranks, against which we have already had to fight strongly, even without a Jewish state. ... If external necessity should after all compel us to assume this burden, let us bear it with tact and patience.\n\nAfter independence, he supported Israel but was critical of the violence that was inflicted to achieve it. (That's a sensible take).\n\n---\n\nEinstein's discourse on Zionism is as a means to right the wrongs done to Jews in Europe and to demand their own homeland as others had. I think it notably lacks mention of the injustices that were to be done and later done to the Palestinians. That's important because those injustices, known globally in retrospect, are the core of the Palestinian issue.\n\nHis statements are not egregious or unexpected. He was neither a decision-maker in the World Zionist Congress / Jewish Agency in Palestine, nor on the ground in Palestine to see the events unfold. He just wanted justice for his people.",

However, they have never stated to conquer the entire Middle East, or Palestine.\n\nThere are many issues with your post but this conclusion you came to is just flat out false, since you brought up Ben Gurion for instance:\n\n\"Does the establishment of a Jewish state \\[in only part of Palestine\\] advance or retard the conversion of this country into a Jewish country? My assumption (which is why I am a fervent proponent of a state, even though it is now linked to partition) is that a Jewish state on only part of the land is not the end but the beginning. This is because this increase in possession is of consequence not only in itself, but because through it we increase our strength, and **every increase in strength helps in the possession of the land as a whole.** The establishment of a state, even if only on a portion of the land, is the maximal reinforcement of our strength at the present time and a powerful boost to our historical endeavors to liberate the entire country.\" \\[9\\]  \n([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937\\_Ben-Gurion\\_letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937_Ben-Gurion_letter))\n\nYou go over a portion of this letter in your post so it's strange you didn't actually examine it in its totality, as you were complaining about others not doing.\n\n...\n\n\"Weizmann and Ben-Gurion pressed for a solution based on partition. Said Weizmann: 'The Jews would be fools not to accept it, even if \\[the land they were allocated\\] were the size of a table cloth.' Both saw partition as a stepping stone to further expansion and the eventual takeover of the whole of Palestine. **'No Zionist can forgo the smallest portion of the Land of Israel,'** Ben-Gurion was quoted as saying.\"  \n([https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr\\_0/page/138/mode/2up?q=stepping+stone](https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr_0/page/138/mode/2up?q=stepping+stone))\n\n...\n\n\"It might be noted that the “boundaries of Zionist aspirations” in Ben Gurion’s “vision” were quite broad, including southern Lebanon, southern Syria, today’s Jordan, all of cis-Jordan, and the Sinai. This was, in fact, one of Ben-Gurion’s constant themes. In internal discussion in 1938, he stated that **“after we become a strong force, as the result of the creation of a state, we shall abolish partition and expand to the whole of Palestine. The state will only be a stage in the realization of Zionism and its task is to prepare the ground for our expansion into the whole of Palestine by a Jewish-Arab agreement. The state will have to preserve order not only by preaching morality but by machine guns, if necessary.”**\n\nThe “agreement” that Ben-Gurion had in mind was to be with King Abdullah of Jordan, who would be induced to cede areas of cis-Jordan under his control, while many of the Arab residents would leave. Earlier, **Ben-Gurion had explained to Arab interlocutors that “our land” included Transjordan, and that it extended from the Sinai to “the source of the Jordan.”** In internal discussion he urged that “we do not suggest now to announce the final aim,” which is “far-reaching,” even more so than the aim of those who were opposing partition. “I am unwilling to abandon the great Jewish vision, the final vision,” he added. This vision, here unspecified in scale, “is an organic, spiritual and ideological component of my Jewishness and my Zionist aspiration,” Ben-Gurion explained.\"  \n([https://archive.org/details/NoamChomskyFatefulTriangleF/page/n287/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/NoamChomskyFatefulTriangleF/page/n287/mode/2up))\n\n...\n\n\"Although the Jewish Agency accepted the partition plan, it did not accept the proposed borders as final and Israel's declaration of independence avoided the mention of any boundaries. A state in part of Palestine was seen as a stage towards a larger state when opportunity allowed. Although the borders were “bad from a military and political point of view,” **Ben Gurion urged fellow Jews to accept the UN Partition Plan, pointing out that arrangements are never final, “not with regard to the regime, not with regard to borders, and not with regard to international agreements.”**\n\nThe idea of partition being a temporary expedient dated back to the Peel Partition proposal of 1937. When the Zionist Congress had rejected partition on the grounds that the Jews had an inalienable right to settle anywhere in Palestine, **Ben Gurion had argued in favour of acceptance: “I see in the realisation of this plan practically the decisive stage in the beginning of full redemption and the most wonderful lever for the gradual conquest of all of Palestine.”**  \n([https://archive.org/details/palestineisraelu0000mcdo/mode/2up?q=full+redemption](https://archive.org/details/palestineisraelu0000mcdo/mode/2up?q=full+redemption))\n\n“After the formation of a large army in the wake of the establishment of the state, we will abolish partition and expand to the whole of Palestine.”  \n— Ben Gurion, p. 22, *The Birth of Israel* (1987), Simha Flapan.\n\n“If it was permissible to move an Arab from the Galilee to Judea, why it is impossible to move an Arab from Hebron to Transjordan, which is much closer? There are vast expanses of land there and we are overcrowded. Even the High Commission agrees to a transfer to Transjordan if we equip the peasants with land and money. If the Peel Commission and the London Government accept, we’ll remove the land problem from the agenda.”",

This constitutes the basis for a genuine understanding between us and the Arabs.” \nBen-Gurion at Labor Conference, quoted in Mendes-Flohr, *A Land of Two Peoples: Martin Buber on Jews and Arabs*, University of Chicago Press, 1983, p. 6.\n\nWalter Laqueur writes in *A History of Zionism* (1972) that the idea of population transfer was never Zionist policy and “Ben-Gurion emphatically rejected it, saying that even if Jews were given the right to evict Arabs they would not make use of it” (p. 232). Laqueur has more along these lines on Ben-Gurion and other Zionist leaders in this same chapter I can add to later, as well as other authors. \n\nEdit: See also Anita Shapira on Ben-Gurion’s crucial decision regarding the West Bank in 1948 war (*Ben Gurion: Father of Modern Israel*, Yale University Press, 1971, p. 173). I believe Benny Morris covers that decision in *1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War* (2008) as well on p. 386 (“urging Ben-Gurion to order the conquest of the West Bank”).",

    "body": "&gt;Ben Gurion: \"We want to have a State of our own, and that State can be federate if the other State or States is or are willing to do so in the mutual interest, on condition that our State is in its own right a Member of the United Nations.\"\n\n&gt;Note that he accepts another state in this discussion, indicating favor towards partition and possible federation (i.e. the economic union proposed in UNSCOP). He also says later in his testimony:\n\nThis is a very misleading reading of Ben Gurion's testimony. Yes, he was not in favor of a bi-national state. But that doesn't mean partition was his favored solution. What he wanted was to establish some sort of trusteeship over the territory, which would allow for large scale Jewish immigration, before establishing a Jewish state in the entirety of Palestine. This was necessary because a democracy could not be established without a Jewish majority.\n\n&gt;CHAIRMAN: On the other hand, we see that you want the abolition of the Mandate and you do not want the substitution of a trusteeship, or something of that kind, for the Mandate. Then the question must come up: how do you think that immigration could be implemented if the Mandate has ceased? What kind of government do you think should be established in this country instead of the Mandate?\n\n&gt;Mr. BEN GURION: Well, that is a very legitimate question, and a very sensible question, and I will try to answer you to the best of my ability. We say that the White Paper policy is illegal, and therefore, it should be removed at once. The Mandate, in fact, does not exist because it was violated by the Mandatory. We are not in favour of renewing it. We do not believe that in the future it will be carried out better than in the past. Therefore, we say that the original intention and the need, and what in our conviction is just, should be decided upon by the United Nations, and a Jewish State should be established.\n\n&gt;There are two parts in the establishment of a state: one is the material part, which is the most essential; the other is the legal part, the purely formal one, which is also of great importance.\n\n&gt;I will say a word about the material establishment, because the whole difficulty of the problem here is that you have a people, you have a country, and their right to the country was acknowledged, but the people do not happen to be there yet. They were dispossessed, and they have to come back. So, the first thing is the material establishment of the state, which means that plans based on our experience and on achievements, examined and approved by experts-economic, irrigation, agricultural, industrial experts, and so on-should be examined by the Committee and the United Nations to see how they can be carried out; and that a million Jews should be resettled in their country.\n\n&gt;In our view it is not only possible, but it is possible to do so by good will. It is possible to do it in a very short time. This is the material establishment of a national home for the Jewish State. This may take some time. In the meantime, it will be supervised by the highest authority of the United Nations. The fact that the Mandatory itself referred it to the United Nations implies a certain recognition that this is the place where it has to be judged and de, decided, although the Mandatory did not undertake formally to carry it out. But there is an indication that this is the place where it should be decided.\n\n&gt;Assuming that on the recommendations of your Committee the United Nations approves of that plan, the material establishment, it means the settlement of the first million Jews I say a million, it may be 900,000 or it may be 1,100,000, to state a round figure-in the shortest possible time. Even the shortest possible time may and must take some time. I am unable to say how long it will take. I think no one is able to say that, because there are always in human affairs unforeseen things which may happen. But it should not take longer, as far as w.e can judge now-it must not take longer than a few years. Not necessarily longer than a few years. Then, in the meantime, a committee, or any instrument which the United Nations will decide on, will supervise.\n\nQuotes continued in comment below",

When the United Nations will see that the main purpose for which, this country is destined, to solve the Jewish problem, that the main thing has been done and that the time is ripe to undertake administration of the Government itself, then the second phase, the legal, the formal establishment of a state will be reached. **Whether it will take two years or three years, I cannot say, but in that transition period it will be in charge of the United Nations. That is all we envisage here.**  \n  \n  \nCHAIRMAN: Let us assume that there would be violent resistance to enforcing the immigration, would you mean, in any circumstances, to go on and fight down the resistance?\n\n&gt;Mr. BEN GURION: I said we do not ask for a Mandate any more, so it is not a question. The question does not arise on the Mandate. But my answer to the question is, you have to decide whether what we ask is right or wrong. If it is right, and force is necessary, you have to apply it. If it is wrong, not only you do not have to apply force, but you do not have to allow it. It is a question of right and wrong, and not whether to apply or not to apply force, as in any other conflict in the world. And this is the reason the United Nations was established.\n\n&gt;Mr. RAND   (Canada):  I suppose that is one case in which you can resort to absolutes.\n\n&gt;Mr. BEN GURION: No absolutes. This was the reason why we were ready in 1937 I mean the majority-to consider a compromise. **Although we knew we were entitled to an entire country, when the British Government came and told us the result of that Commission, they said, you are right, but this will require force and we do not want it and we cannot do it, and therefore we tell you here is a compromise. The majority said, that they were willing to consider it.**  \n\n\n  \n...  \n\n\n&gt;  \nCHAIRMAN: I think, Mr. GARCIA GRANDOS, that you overlooked one factor in Mr. BEN GURION's previous answer. **This transition period was aimed at creating a Jewish majority, and that is the reason for the supervision.**\n\n&gt;Mr. GARCIA GRANDOS (Guatemala): **That is why I would like to ask you whether it refers to the whole of Palestine or to part of Palestine the transition period, I mean.**\n\n&gt;Mr. BEN GURION: **I said that in a part of Palestine we do not need any transitional period. If it is the whole of Palestine, we may need a short transitional period.**\n\n[https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-178863/](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-178863/)",

Some (20%) reported their most significant concern being personal safety. A majority reported food supply/diversity as being inadequate, however only 1% reported \"securing food\" as their most significant concern.\n\nHere is a study measuring food deliveries into Gaza that overlaps with the maternal-infant outcomes study:\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11818336/\n\nI don't know what sources you have been reading and I don't know what they are reporting.

Condoms are actually a good one because many people are actually not aware of how to properly store condoms, how to properly apply, how to tell if the condom breaks and what to do if it does. But condoms, if used perfectly, has a 98% success rate for pregnancy and an effective rate of 85-87% because of the above issues. That means that out of 100 people all using condoms you can expect every year 15-17 of them will have a baby.

It's true, they're still pumping 'em out far above the international average, but we must remember that this average is falling both the world over and of course within Palestinian society within and outside the territories. For Palestinians within Israel and the territories the fertility rate used to be around 9, which was an \\*eye-watering\\* number. The immediate diaspora was probably similar, given their rate of growth. Still, it's down to either half that or in some cases approaching a more a \"western\" rate, depending on where you look and who you look at. \n\nNow, we don't really have the data necessary to make an accurate assessment of how the present stage of the conflict will affect fertility rates either now (reported births are reportedly down 41%, but \"recorded births\" is the operative phrase here) or within the next few years. However, we can make some ballpark speculation and assume it'll probably go up. Access to healthcare was a \\*big\\* reason for the global drop in fertility over the 20th century, since it upended one of the main reasons for pumping out kids, which was general childhood mortality. Well, the healthcare system is in ruins and will probably remain so for at least a few years. And the natural human response to increased childhood mortality, as we've seen the world over, is really just \"keep on pumpin' \". Y'know, roll the dice, if you make more well then at least a couple of em might make it to adulthood. That'll probably lead to a brief explosion in fertility if healthcare is rebuilt rapidly, as was the case with the 20th century expansion of healthcare infrastructure, which should of course occur for moral reasons but even so one must acknowledge what can also occur alongside.",

In it, she asked her followers for recommendations for bagels in New York, specifying, “I don’t want to be giving any of my money to genocidal maniacs,” and adding that she was looking for shops that are either “actively pro-Palestinian” or “known to not be in support of that hell-hole place and Zionism” – clearly seeking to avoid Jewish-owned stores.\"\n\n\"On October 17, 2023, in response to an explosion outside the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, Save the Children’s Country Director for the West Bank and Gaza Jason Lee said stated, “Our worst fears are being realized. We’re seeing schools and hospitals – places of safety and sanctuary – being targeted. Civilian infrastructure like hospitals and schools must be protected at all times.” Lee ignored the videos, images, and intelligence materials demonstrating that an Islamic Jihad rocket had “misfired” (i.e. detonated in Gaza instead of Israel) and hit the hospital parking lot.\"\n\n\"In October 2020, Save the Children published a report on “the impact of the Israeli military detention system on Palestinian children.” Save the Children itself acknowledged that the data presented in the publication “is not a statistically significant or representative sample. As the report intentionally presents children’s experience from their own perspective, it is also important to note that incidents they mention have not been independently verified by Save the Children”. The report severely downplays the extent and severity of violence committed by Palestinian minors against Israeli civilians and soldiers, and ignores the widespread phenomena of incitement prevalent in the West Bank.\"\n\n\n\"In November 2018, during the violence on the Gaza border, Save the Children stated that “The Israeli government must end the use of sniper fire and live ammunition against children in Gaza. The killing and wounding of children is never acceptable.” Save the Children does not question why these children were present in an obviously violent situation where there was a known potential for injury, nor does the organization condemn Hamas and other Palestinian terror groups’ recruitment and use of children throughout the violence. The NGO also ignored the violent nature of the protests, which have consisted of an organized armed attack on the Israeli border and IDF positions, attempts to destroy and breach the border fence, and sustained arson, rocket, and mortar attacks on Israeli civilian communities.\"\n\n\n\"On May 18, 2018, Save the Children and the Palestinian Center for Democracy and Conflict Resolution sponsored a workshop at the Dar al Huda kindergarten, “Training of Teachers on Positive Discipline in Everyday Teaching.”\nOn May 26, 2018, the Dar al Huda kindergarten in Gaza held a graduation ceremony that included the mock killing and kidnapping of Israelis by children dressed as combatants.1 The simulation included sophisticated equipment such as drones, body cameras, military fatigues, body armor, and sniper camouflage. Children wore headbands representing Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), designated as a terrorist organization by the US, EU, and others.\"\n\n\n\"During the 2014 Gaza conflict, Save the Children published a full-page advertisement in papers throughout the UK of the names of Palestinian children who were killed; a similar list of Israeli children was not produced.\"\n\n\n\"Save the Children has repeatedly joined in the demonization campaign falsely accusing Israel of employing starvation as a method of warfare against Hamas. These allegations have been repeatedly shown to be based on fundamental methodological errors and overwhelmingly disproven by publicly available information.\"",

This tactic is also referred to as Palestinian suicide terrorism. It emerged in the 1990s and reached its peak during the Second Intifada (2000–2005). Attacks occurred at various locations, including shopping centers, public buses, transit stations, cafes, nightclubs, and restaurants, According to a 2006 study from the University of Haifa, only a few of the bombings targeted military objectives. Between 1994 and 2005, suicide bombings killed 735 Israelis and wounded 4,554.\"\n\n\nFrom Yasser Arafat himself:\n\n“All of us are willing to be martyrs… until our flag flies over Jerusalem…” — In a speech to Palestinian workers in Gaza in January 1995, Arafat spoke of being willing to die in the struggle and tied that to “martyrdom.”\n\n“The commitment still stands… via deaths, via sacrifices.” — At Al-Azhar University in Gaza in June 1995, he invoked jihad and sacrifice in the fight against Israel, a phrase critics argue was used to legitimize violence.\n\n“We ask Allah to grant us martyrdom… To Jerusalem we march, martyrs by the millions.”\n\n“We ask Allah to grant us martyrdom… To Jerusalem we march, martyrs by the millions.”\n\nhttps://palwatch.org/page/297\n\nYasser Arafat, in a speech to children:\n\n     \"We are saluting the spirit of our hero Shahid, Faris Ouda! Faris Ouda! Faris Ouda! We are proud of you [youth] who represent the steadfastness and the sacrifice of your companion, the hero Shahid, Faris Ouda! Oh, children of Palestine! The peers, friends, brothers and sisters of Faris Ouda.\"\n\nNote: Faris Ouda is a 14 year-old who prepared his own memorial before going off to become a Shahid.",

By claiming to be some shield against the “savage Arabs and Palestinians” and saying that the country is for Jews and protects them, you act on Jews’ behalf even when they don’t want to be associated with a kid-bombing country.  3. I can’t find this document anywhere just people talking about it. Can you link it? Also, I’m a little skeptical seeing how it mentioned that a commander was killed for being gay when it’s unconfirmed if that story is true. The video you linked is the same story. The people sexually assaulted or raped by Hamas were Israeli hostages, it isn’t some cartel-linked chain of traffickers. That is deplorable and I don’t support Hamas at all. I support resistance and since they are the resistors right now I support the cause but not everything they do. \n\nSidenote: Imagine if all Jews hated Black people during the Holocaust but Black people around the world continued to protest and lobby for intervention to stop the Nazis from murdering the Jews, would you tell those protestors “Oh but if you were in Hungary they would eat you alive”? Obviously not. I can’t find recognize a genocide and say “That’s wrong”, I don’t care what the victims of that genocide thinks of me. It’s prob the stupidest fucking point.",

I also don’t think we should throw molotov cocktails at protestors so I’m glad we agree. I was saying that Israel fuels some of the anti-semitism around the world. Some people just hate Jews and antisemites use that as an excuse while others believe Israel represents the Jewish people when it doesn’t.\n\n1. Again, Mahmoud Ishwiti’s story isn’t confirmed and I haven’t seen any list of militants executed, just people talking about it.\n\n2. I literally never said it was ok please stop strawmanning me. I’m clarifying because the way you said it made it seem as if it was something similar to what cartels do. The first source you gave me said the children being taken advantage of was a result of the war but those unsavory characters would still be around but it doesn’t really back up your claim, just goes to show another bad thing that happened because of the war. The second source just highlights the things Israel is doing wrong to prevent labor trafficking. Third source is horrible but Hamas and ISIS are enemies so how would one be an ISIS and Hamas member?",

Russia actually IS engaging in atrocities, but people aren't attacking westerners of Russian descent.

Article 9 of Japaness constitution prohibits war and offensive forces. The US military base there is meant to protect Japan, among other objectives. Things are changing, Japan does have a well-equipped self defense force and a growing trend to amend the constitution. \n\nEven then, Japan and other neighboring countries will feel better with a US military base in the region to help deter Chinese aggression andmaintain peace in the region.\n\nhttps://asia.nikkei.com/spotlight/trump-administration/iran-crisis-sparks-concern-of-loss-of-us-carrier-coverage-in-asia (English language Newspaper based in Japan) Iran crisis sparks concern of loss of US carrier coverage in Asia.

While \"anti-zionists\" pretend not to notice.\n\n[https://www.livemint.com/news/world/hamas-tortured-executed-militants-for-gay-sex-homosexual-conversations-secret-documents-reveal-11738834325406.html](https://www.livemint.com/news/world/hamas-tortured-executed-militants-for-gay-sex-homosexual-conversations-secret-documents-reveal-11738834325406.html)\n\nThey'll even torture fellow Hamas leaders to death for being gay:\n\n [https://youtu.be/suBNwUz8Lvs](https://youtu.be/suBNwUz8Lvs)\n\nAnd that's not even touching on the sex trafficking of women and children, and all the other lovely things that Hamas does that the \"anti-zionists\" have repeatedly made it clear they don't care about.

But I certainly trend further right in discussing the conflict, and I think the way that happens is illustrative to many aspects of the conflict itself.\n\nContextually, the historical positions at various ends of the spectrum have developed and moved (and pushed people) a great deal over time. It was fairly easy to be a classic liberal in favor of world peace and a stable international order, including the 2SS process, in the 1990s. But the peace process got us nowhere, and withdrawal from Gaza got us 20 years of Hamas.\n\nAs for the worst rhetoric, I mean, the same comes from 'your' side, both from the actual Muslims, who are *deeply* right wing, and call openly and proudly for genocide of Jews every time they open their mouths, to their allies on the left, who seem to have little problem un-masking and marching to slogans like 'gas the Jews.'\n\nI don't think Palestinians are fake, but I'm not sure that their identity is special in any way various other ethnic identities in the region or the entire world isn't, that it means they have more rights to not just a state, but all the land they want, in exclusion of other people. Why do they deserve more than the Kurds? Or the Catalonians? And while there is racist Islamophobia, Islamophobia has also clearly become a default go-to shield to excuse the obvious and open horrors of global Islamic society. I can reject both, call a duck a duck, and call the violent, sexist, homophobic, racial-and-religious supremacists extremists in charge of every sharia society across the planet the primitive chuds and threats to the human race that they are.\n\nUltimately, I consider that my movement hasn't been from the left to the right, but from idealist to realist. Going back to Gaza, pulling out got 20 years of increased violence of the worst kinds. Land for peace is disproven. We've now basically reset to square one. At that point, is it logical to try and do the same thing again? Do you expect the outcome to be different the 2nd time around? Or do you admit that the assumptions of the peace process in that era were probably flawed, and you have to look at different more realistic solutions.",

You're probably not going to find the perfect answer in the comments on reddit. My own meager take?\n\nI don't know what a perfect solution is. But I can still work from extrapolation and induction in terms of what has been tried, and what the outcomes have been. Gaza proved that peace for Israel next to an armed Palestinian state is impossible (and it was only unofficially armed; the idea that the outcome wouldn't be 10x worse with Iran able to freely ship in weapons without a blockade is... lol). Democratic processes in the Middle East overwhelmingly elect violent jihadists (see not only Gaza, but pre-coup Egypt). It is absolutely part of what the average Muslim wants. So self-ruling, armed, fully sovereign Palestinians? Yeah, not realistic for a policy goal of 'Peace.' \n\nWhat remains isn't really pretty. Occupation in the near term. Puppet governments and heavy external interference in the medium term. Maybe some kind of controlled federal system in the very long term, if the Palestinians can actually start to de-radicalize through those prior eras. That last one is probably 50+ years out.",

I've never encountered any serious Christian Zionist teacher or book claiming that Jews need to gather in Israel so they can all die horribly while Christians get raptured to heaven, and honestly that's such a cartoonish misrepresentation that it makes me wonder where you even got this idea from because it sure wasn't from actually reading what these people believe. The actual theological framework most Christian Zionists work from comes straight out of the Tanakh (books like Zechariah and Ezekiel written by *your* prophets) which prophesy that in the last days Israel will be restored, attacked by nations, and then God will personally intervene to defend them and judge the world based on how they treated the Jewish people, and plenty of Christians also draw on their own scriptures which predict that *Christians* (not Jews) will face severe persecution before Christ returns, so if anything the shoe's on the other foot regarding who's supposedly dying horribly.\n\nYou're also confusing the rapture with the second coming which suggests you don't actually understand the eschatological framework you're critiquing, and not even all Christian Zionists believe in a pre-tribulation rapture anyway so you're attacking a position that isn't even universally held among the group you're criticizing. What's really going on here is that many Christians support Israel for the same reasons other Westerners do (shared democratic values, common threats, cultural affinity) and yes some *also* have theological reasons rooted in believing that God's covenantal promises to the Jewish people still stand, but reducing that to \"they want us all dead so they can go to heaven\" is exactly the kind of bad faith misrepresentation that anti-Zionists use to drive wedges between Israel and one of its most reliable support bases. You can disagree with Christian eschatology all you want but at least represent what people actually believe before you call them creepy, because right now you're essentially repeating talking points designed by people who want to isolate Israel by convincing Jews that their Christian allies are secretly hoping for their destruction, which is both factually wrong and strategically foolish.",

Other questions are generalizations based on fair arguments. I'm not sure what the analogy for \"Zionist is a slur\" - that Islam has bad rep? Let's try to answer your Q's:\n\n&gt;palestinians are squatters on jewish land\n\nSaid by those who believe the land is Jewish either because it used to be ruled by Jews (historical precedence) or the providence of God to the Jews (religious doctrine). The former is fallacy (right by might and the Jews lost), and the latter is stupid - unless you're religious, in which case you just believe whatever you want.\n\n&gt;palestinians are arabs from arabia, jordan, and egypt\n\nIt's an ignorant take - the Arab conquest Arabized the locals, it didn't replace them with Arabs. I think it doesn't matter because the Arabs that are in Palestine today are Palestinians enough, for all intents and purposes. But it wasn't always the case.\n\n&gt;palestinians are a fake people\n\nProbably rooted in the Palestinian nationality being a recent concept. The first *Palestinian* Arab congress took place in 1919. The local elites defined their \"Palestinian\" identity thusly:\n\n&gt; We consider Palestine nothing but part of Arab Syria, and it has never been separated from it at any stage. We are tied to it by national, religious, linguistic, moral, economic, and geographic bounds\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Syria\n\nIdentities evolve and so do national identities. It took decades past this point for the modern Palestinian identity to coalesce, and I believe it wouldn't have become distinguishable from Syrian or Pan-Arab identity had it not been for the Jews emerging as a local sovereignty, while the rest of the Arabs were defeated in claiming the land and its inhabitants for themselves.\n\nI'll remind you that, in the decades following Israel's creation, Egypt, Jordan and Syria invaded Palestine to claim it for themselves, not to \"free the Palestinians\".\n\n&gt;\"muslim behavior is the reason for islamophobia\"\n\nA generalization ignoring bigotry and racism. But let's look at some dry statistics:\n\n\\- All Arab states are dictatorships\n\n\\- Islam is the dominant religion in the world's most violent countries\n\n\\- Islam is the dominant religion in global terrorism\n\nCombine these 3 with Islam's expansionist doctrine and natural demographics, and you've got a good reason to fear Islam.\n\n&gt;\"why should palestinians get western treatment when they behave like animals\"\n\nThis is a bit of a generalization, and I don't know about \"animals\", but *collectively*, Palestinians do not adhere to Western values. The idea that Palestinians would somehow erect a western democracy, let alone sustain one, is complete fantasy and has no historical evidence to support it.",

I think you need to check Ayn Rand and why any right that is contingent on another person providing it as your slave is not an actual right. If USA and Israel are the only countries who voted against this, then it's truly sad, and socialism won. \n\n\nTo answer your question though Israel voted because US voted. Israel votes with US because that's the special relationship and Israel is an ally of the US. Of course then the \"woke right\" asks why Israel is an ally. This is why. Israel votes automatically with US in every UN resolution and in returns *hopes* (with no guarantees at all) that US vetos anti Israel resolutions (on the UNSC). Unfortunate that Israel did not develop more relationships with other veto countries although before the Ukraine war it made great progress with Russia. And there is potential with China but it's blocked by the US. Complicated relationships with France and UK who usually give in to the Arabs.\n\n\nThe support of Israel to the US is the *only* reason why Israel voted like this. Ideologically, and unfortunately in my opinion since I support the Ayn Rand objectivist view, Israel is a very socialist minded country. The \"Left\"  in Israel usually supports this idea of food as a right and the Jewish Orthodox and Muslims in Israel obviously do too... And then you are left with the \"Right\", well surprisingly the Right in Israel is NOT actually capitalist, and the spiritual leader of the secular right was Zeev Zabotinsky (father of the predecessor of the Likud) and he famously declared that not only was food a right but also housing and clothes and education and health.\n\n\n \"Capitalism\" in Israel especially in the last 30 years was driven somewhat by Netanyahu (personally with a few other individuals) and by some forces in the Left and even the more radical Left actually.

Like you say, it is possible for people to not have food without any malice or oppression on the part of others.  It's not a right like freedom of speech, which requires active suppression.  And the concern with codifying it as a right is that it then binds uninvolved parties to fix problems out of their control.\n\nUp until recently, most of the burden of providing humanitarian aid has fallen on the United States and so it's easy for other countries who don't expect to have to fill the gaps to vote on a resolution that sounds good, but wouldn't obligate them to intervention.\n\n  \nHere's the official statement from the US: https://geneva.usmission.gov/2017/03/24/u-s-explanation-of-vote-on-the-right-to-food/.  Much of it talks about specific language in the resolution, but it ends with this: \"Furthermore, we reiterate that states are responsible for implementing their human rights obligations.  This is true of all obligations that a state has assumed, regardless of external factors, including, for example, the availability of technical and other assistance.\n\nWe also do not accept any reading of this resolution or related documents that would suggest that States have particular extraterritorial obligations arising from any concept of a right to food.\n\nLastly, we wish to clarify our understandings with respect to certain language in this resolution.  The United States supports the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living, including food, as recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Domestically, the United States pursues policies that promote access to food, and it is our objective to achieve a world where everyone has adequate access to food, but we do not treat the right to food as an enforceable obligation.  The United States does not recognize any change in the current state of conventional or customary international law regarding rights related to food.  The United States is not a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  Accordingly, we interpret this resolution’s references to the right to food, with respect to States Parties to that covenant, in light of its Article 2(1).  We also construe this resolution’s references to member states’ obligations regarding the right to food as applicable to the extent they have assumed such obligations.\"",

I'm not aware of Israel publishing its reasoning, but they do have a longstanding tradition of voting alongside the USA.\n\nHere is the USA's reason for voting \"no\" as described in the document: \n\n1. The draft did not offer meaningful, concrete steps to solving the problem.\n2. It did not give enough focus on famine often being primarily manmade, the result of conflict. The way to resolve those famines is by ending the conflicts.\n3. It inappropriately discussed trade, which had already been covered in other treaties.\n4. It contained some specific line items with which the USA disagreed. Specifically, on pesticides, on climate change, and on technology transfer.\n5. The responsibility for implementing human rights obligations is on the state, not on the international community.\n\nThey wrap it up with this (emphasis mine):\n\n&gt;**The United States supports the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living, including food**, as recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Domestically, the United States pursues policies that promote access to food, and it is our objective to achieve a world where everyone has adequate access to food, but **we do not treat the right to food as an enforceable obligation.**",

Basically, Palestine existed as much the nowadays Russian-engineered and created Donetsk People's Republic.\n\nPalestine only then existed after the Roman Empire wiped out and genocided Kingdom of Israel and that too only as a part of a colonial empire never as an independent state or kingdom. From then on it went through Arab Conquest, Ottoman Empire and then finally the British Empire under it's own British Mandate of Palestine 1917-1948 which is the closest it ever got to a state. Even after that though Egypt and Jordan occupied parts of it, Egypt did Gaza and Jordan the West Bank from 1948-1967 after which Israel won those territories due to victory in the Six Days War 1967. Israel then left 4 settlements in the WB and Gaza in 2005 giving an opportunity for a Palestinian state but even nowadays it is not a state and only the PLO has observer status at the UN regarding Palestine.\n\nPro-Palestinian activism centers around the 2SS or 2 State Solution as one of its points precisely because Palestine is not a state yet otherwise 2SS would have 0 meaning.\n\n**So either pro-Palestinan activism partially has 0 meaning or Palestine is not and was never a state?

The concept of Indonesian was a project started by an anti-colonialist political party, Sarekat Islam, who in 1912, promoted the idea that 'Indonesian' was any person living under Dutch colonial rule in the Dutch East Indies (they were initially founded to oppose Chinese traders, but within a year pivoted to Indonesian nationalism). This arcepelego spanning concept of nationality, for a time, competed with the Island based independence movements, that promoted natavist, blood and land, concept of nationality. The more familiar inherited nationality. In the 1920-30s these natavist independence movements disbanded and merged with the arcepelego spanning nationality, both were united in their opposition to Dutch colonial rule. In 1945, shortly after Japanese occupation ended, Indonesian nationalists declared independence, resulting in a conflict between Indonesian nationalists, the Dutch colonial power (and allied countries) and well as an internal struggle, often against communists (a bit of a mess). Over 100,000 people were killed.",

People feel overpowered by trump. We have fought and fought and fought anf the world has still gone to shit. There is no such thing as democracy. No respect for human life anymore. And there's no hiding it. Men in power don't care about lives. They care about oil, money and power. Donald Trump is a psychopath who cant be stopped. He has even openly stated the most grotesque things. He invented peace that doesnt exist in palestine and demanded a prize for it. The world is a non-sensical mess and men on power trips have destroyed it.\n\nAlso because the tech bros are pro trump (because of money) there is censorship of a lot of accounts. So im sure there are people less jaded than me who are being vocal. But they are struggling to get seen. Because the media is corrupt. Trump is also checking everyone's social media for the past 5 year if they are to get visas. So there's a massive clamp down on activism. Hes also using brute force on immigrants. So yeah, people are being threatened and brutalised into shutting up \n\nFor me, Palestine specifically is something I have invested my time heavily in understanding and fighting for for about 20 years now and we have always been fighting for it. Its has been a consistent and ongoing hell for the palestian people for decades. There have been hundreds of other atrocities but none as long and continuously oppressive as this in my opinion. \n\nFree Palestine 🇵🇸 ✊️",

One of the core calls of this movement was that EVERYONE and their grandmother need to at all times look at and talk about Gaza and basically nothing else. It was made out to be THE most important humanitarian issue of our time, a litmus test for moral clarity for some and there wasn’t a single white people city in the world, where you wouldn’t find graffiti about Palestine and hating Israel. All of that really does beg the question, what it is that made this topic so much more important and the war so much worse, than for example Ukraine, Sudan, Congo, the Uygurs in China, the Kurds in Syria and turkey, being ethnically cleansed,  etc.. And to be honest, people couldn’t give coherent explanation, that wouldn’t fit the other issues too, or even better, especially regarding personal involvement. Which led to people rightfully asking the question, if the movement wasn’t heavily influenced by antisemites, since one of the core ideas seemed to be the delegitimization and destruction of Israel, as the only way to gain freedom for Palestinians, even over the reality of Hamas and fatah abusing their own people. ",

You’re just proving what we have said to be the main problem all along: most pro Palestine protesters are scarily oblivious to what is going on in swana and it makes them easily manipulated by jihadist propaganda.

And just as long, there have been uprisings and do you know why pro Palestinians don’t care? Because the people they got their information about Gaza from, the news networks, organizations and independent reporters that “speak the truth” apart from the “evil western media”, were just as funded by Iran as Hamas and Hezbollah. Who do you think build that “worldwide network” that somehow immediately organized pro Palestine demonstrations on October 8th and started this giant media campaign? Do you think it is a coincidence, that organizations that supposedly collected humanitarian help for Gaza, kept being dismantled and forbidden for actually funneling the literal millions in help directly to Hamas? The main idea was always to discredit Israel, make people forget about October 7th and all the other terror attacks, that clearly show Hamas intent and frame Gaza as this enclave of brave freedom fighters, that have been unfairly imprisoned and not, because their goddamn population declared war on Israel and has become a significant danger to Israeli civilians on every contact. The reason you are not aware that Iran has been oppressed for decades, the reason they don’t get the same support, is that they have no lobby, because they are not Arab and the ones oppressing them are not Jews ore westerners.

Knowing a bunch of IDF soldiers personally, I can tell you the chain of events normally is more like this: \n1. Hamas declares war on Israel by slaughtering 2000 people in one day (by hand and face to face, not through bombs) and abducting over 200 more.\n2. Israel reacts by going into Gaza and trying to destroy Hamas military.\n3. Hamas don’t try to defend Gaza at the borders or in front of the cities like in any other war, to keep the fighting AWAY from their civilian population,(see Ukraine), but employ their soldiers INTO their heavily populated cities, building military infrastructure right within civil infrastructure, while not wearing uniform and therefore being indistinguishable from civilians. (Both war crimes)\n4. Israel tries to navigate the thus created highly chaotic urban warzone, by letting people evacuate, but is shot at from non combat zones from sniper or rocket launcher spots, which nearly always happen to sit on top of homes, hospitals, schools, etc.\n5. Israel bombs the thus created military infrastructure (look at rules for international warfare) to protect their soldiers.\n6. Hamas publishes horrifying videos of the children Israel supposedly killed on purpose, by bombing a house or school, conveniently leaving out step 1-5.\n7. People in the west that have no clue about war zones and their rules start rioting.\n\nNot to say, that the Likud isn’t a party of racist a-holes that need to go down, or that there aren’t racists in the IDF that use their power to torment and unnecessarily kill Palestinian civilians. Or that the slow land grabbing in the West Bank shouldn’t stop. But I highly doubt that ANY of the people protesting even have the hint of an idea, how many of those civilian deaths are actually due to Hamas war tactics, that are specifically designed to get their own people killed as martyrs and their deaths used as war propaganda in the west. A tactic that seems to work, looking at the amount of help money that Hamas related organizations in western countries have already funneled directly to Hamas before they were uncovered. If Hamas was a normal government that fought to protect their citizens and provided shelter in bunkers for the civilians, the numbers of deaths would be a clearer sign of intend. Since that is not the case, the sole number of supposedly civilians dying (which is also provided by Hamas) is not really telling us anything except the tragedy of loss of human lives.

Their goal is to accomplish that at any cost, even the cost of their own people. \n\nIn fact, we saw this with Hamas, where not only do they not care about the civilians, their own people, but the pain and suffering of the civilians is directly seen as additional legitimacy to their cause. The more deaths, the more they gain legitimacy towards their cause. At the same time, it also helps fuel the victim narrative and propaganda both at home and abroad to be used against the enemy. \n\nMake no mistake, the regime is not remotely bothered by how may of its civilians it killed. For 45 years it has failed at absolutely everything other than creating a magnificent police a control apparatus to remain in power. \n\nThis means, you can bomb, out boots on the ground, even kill leaders, and at the end of the day it won’t matter. At the very top, the leaders and their closest allies don’t suffer from any of it. They have internet, they have money, they can travel, and their families don even live in Iran. \n\nThe only way to beat them is to dismantle the policing mechanism internally that gives the control.

If people continue assuming using weapons against the regime will actually strengthen it rather than weaken it there’s nothing to talk about. \n\nFinal thought - Hamas was significantly weakened by the Israeli military campaign. The losses weakened it. The people in Gaza have less support for Hamas in Gaza due to the very reasonable concern that Hamas is using them as human shields. Hamas kost the war. While Hamas became more popular than ever among “progressive” lunatics in western countries, their legitimacy among Gaza is diminished. Plus, they don’t have nearly as much military strength.

Targeted sanctions on every single mid to senior member of leadership that extends beyond just them but their families and friends. Essentially the way this regime comes down is only by making supporting them absolutely toxic. \n\nIsrael assassinated their top leadership during the last war. It didn’t bring down the regime it just weakened them. You need to destroy the police mechanisms. \n\nTarget all their communication capabilities so that they can’t block internet. Flood civilians with as much internet as possible, and provide training on how to stay protected from the regime. \n\nOf course if we have the chance to take out the leader, by all means go for it. But he is already old and frail, and likely has successors already set up. You have to break them not kill them. \n\nIt is why all the sanctions so far have not helped.

In 1967 the Egyptians said 10k plus Israeli soldiers had died when the numbers at the time were closer to 200 casualties. \n\nIn the many wars this tactic continued and the claim became laughable; especially after the facts became clearer and the 'estimates' were always reversed and circa 10x+ Arab deaths to Jewish deaths - in wars that Arabs started!! \n\nEven the 1973 War (which the Arabs consider themselves to have 'won') - in it the Israelis were fighting combined forces of millions of soldiers and were outnumbered in tanks maybe 5:1 and machinery by a lot more - yet the final result were casualties far higher on the Arab side, and Israel conquered mass amounts of Arab territory. \n\nSo the Arabs understood that the policy had to change 180:  to now inflate the numbers of Arab victims and claim no Israelis were killed in wars started by again the Arabs. It may sound moronic (and is) but world opinion sucked it up and it has fallen for this new tactic, and sympathy has moved from the start up (post Holocaust) Jewish nation to a poor newly created Palestinian nation supported by the wealth of the oil rich Arab family. \n\nI personally don't think that many Arabs live in the West Bank or Gaza. Google says 15.2m Palestinians in the world - compared to 1948 which said 1.2-1.3m - that is circa a 3.35% yearly increase despite all the wars. Really?! Does that seem reasonable? And consider that they are all still 'refugees' being supported by the UN - apparently 700k left Israel in 1948 and became close to 6m now. It seems that the refugee status is not just inheritable to 5 generations but also expanding to all that feel that they are Palestinians or Arab. But again the world sucks it up and lavishes cash on them.\n\nIn comparison - Jews who are known to have high birth rates have gone from around 11m in 1948 to just under 16m in 2025. \n\nAll the numbers just don't make sense, so using the hospital massacre figures which started at circa 500 and ended at 100 (and 5x false increase and killed by the Arabs not Israelis) -  so 70k which probably includes 20-30k soldiers would leave 40k civilians which could means as low as 8000 civilian death - but who knows!!",

They have murdered over 71,000 civilians, and that number is clearly higher due to all the unrecovered bodies. 20,000 of those have been children. There is substantial evidence the IDF has targeted civilians.\n\nIsrael has thousands of Palestinians held in prisons without due process or a conviction. This was true before October 7.\n\nIsrael regularly evicts people from homes and ethnically cleanses villages, demolishes homes with an hour's notice before the residents' eyes, to make room for new settlements or for other unjustified purposes. This predated October 7 by a long time..\n\nIsraeli soldiers regularly raid Palestinian businesses and sabotage them, run over street vendors, and beat kids in the street. This was true before October 7 and is much worse today.\n\nIsraeli settler terrorists regularly invade Palestinian villages to terrorize the residents and beat them, under the protection of the IDF. This was true before October 7 and is much worse today.\n\nIsraeli terrorists and IDF soldiers often beat Palestinians to a pulp and then BLOCK THE AMBULANCES FROM REACHING THEM.\n\nIn the days of Israel's founding (1947-49), Israeli soldiers massacred entire villages, evicted Palestinians from homes and beat anyone who fought back, looted Palestinian homes, and regularly shot Palestinians for not complying, mirroring the actions of _________ (word deleted because of bot) in Europe.\n\nThis is why people think Israel is in the wrong.",

Didn't it consider them as inferior people who should only obey? Even today, Israeli-Palestinian citizens do not have the same rights as Jewish citizens.\n\nOne should admit that Israel wanted to rule and decide over Palestinians who should only obey. Palestinians protested of course, various agreements were made but they were not followed and so the situation for them became worse and worse. So Palestinians took up tougher resistance until it became what it became. Unfortunately. They did not expect it to become what it became. The original purpose of 7/10 was to show Israel that enough is enough and that the world wakes up and starts counting Palestinians among people.\n\nBut chaos ensued and so it became what it became, unfortunately.\n\nNo one was innocent, not Palestinians, but not Israelis either. I don't believe in such propaganda about children being burned, etc. Otherwise I'll start talking about how the IDF burned hundreds of people in Gaza, killed even their own, danced in front of destroyed schools, churches, how Palestinian prisoners are treated in prisons where they often ended up without a legal reason. Etc.\n\nIf I were Israel on 7/10 I would take a serious look at why it happened, would start thinking selflessly, about all people regardless of ethnic origin and actually admit that I could have acted a little differently, not harmed Palestinians as much as I did before. And certainly not killed as many as I did, not devastated all of Gaza either. And not murdered them after agreeing on a ceasefire, but I would follow in this case the 20 points the US has put forward.\n\nNote that I am an outsider and my ethnic origin is only European, not Arab or Jewish.",

But I don't agree that you came there as the mistress of the world and continue to act like it. You've already wiped out a lot of Palestinian villages incl. their names, you've built your own houses on those places, like Tel Aviv University, which was built on a Palestinian village which the Haganah had already destroyed.

    "body": "I appreciate you sharing your perspective as a European observer. It’s a complex situation, but to have a truly balanced conversation, there are several factual and legal points that need to be cleared up regarding the claims you’ve made.\n\nFirst, it is a common misconception that Arab-Israeli citizens (who make up about 21% of the population) have inferior legal status. Under Israeli law, they have full and equal rights: they vote in every election, hold seats in the Knesset (Parliament), and serve as judges on the Supreme Court. In fact, an Arab party was part of the governing coalition recently. While there are certainly socioeconomic disparities and historical tensions - much like minority populations face in Europe - it is inaccurate to say they lack the same rights as Jewish citizens.\n\nRegarding the idea that 10/7 was a protest that turned into ‘chaos’ or that atrocities were ‘propaganda’: multiple international bodies, including the UN and Human Rights Watch, have documented that the attacks involved systematic massacres, torture, sexual violence, and kidnapping. Captured documents and body-cam footage from the attackers themselves showed that the targeting of civilians was not an accident, but a pre-planned objective with specific maps of civilian communities.\n\nYou asked why the division didn’t happen.\nIt’s important to note that Israel has agreed to a two-state solution multiple times, as OP mentioned. Beyond the 1947 partition, Israel made significant offers in the Oslo Accords, Camp David Summits, and the 2008 Olmert Plan, which would have seen the creation of a Palestinian state on nearly all of the West Bank and Gaza. These offers were rejected by Palestinian leadership.\n\nRegarding the US 20-point plan you mentioned- that framework actually requires the complete demilitarization of Gaza and the removal of Hamas from power to ensure safety for both sides. It would require both leaderships to protect their civilians, something Hamas failed to do by using civilian infrastructure for military purposes.\n\nFinally, I’m not sure if you realize that Israel is a self-critical democracy. There is a robust Israeli Left and a massive network of peace activists who continuously advocate for a two-state solution and Palestinian rights. Even in the middle of a war, Israelis protest their own government and hold leaders accountable. This internal democratic pressure is exactly what allows for the possibility of change.",

    "body": "You have quite a one-sided view of the conflict and seem to have accepted only the zionist framing.\n\n&gt;Correct my statements if they are wrong as I am still learning about the war. From what I know, Britain promised the region to the Jews and the Arabs at the same time, of course this will start a war\n\nKinda? Britain committed itself to establish a Jewish national home in Palestine in 1917 with the Balfour Declaration. They also separately promised to support an independent Arab state in exchange for Arab support in defeating the Ottoman Empire. You could say that they are incompatible commitments, and in a way they are, but the important part is the actions that followed. \n\nAfter 1917 Britain worked with the zionist settlers to create quasi-state infrastructure in Palestine for the zionists and brutally suppressed the Palestinian opposition. So you can say they followed through on their commitment made in the Balfour Declaration. On the other hand, they did not follow through on their commitment to an independent Arab state. They secretly agreed with France how the region should be split between them in the Sykes Picot agreement. \n\n&gt;How would that be Israel’s fault for coming back to their ancestral homeland when the owner of the land tells you that you can have it?\n\nWell first because Britain wasn't the 'owner of the land', it was a colonial power. And more importantly because there were already people living there. Settlers coming to a place and demanding the natives leave so they can establish a state is still wrong whether or not the settlers view it as their ancestral homeland.   \n\n\n&gt;Despite this Israel tries to have a 2 state solution 4 different times. Palestine denies it every time and starts wars with Israel. Israel wins every time and Palestine loses land because of it. Again I ask, how does that make Israel the bad guy?\n\nI'm not sure what the 4 times you are referring to, but this is at best a very one sided way of presenting the history. After 1948, you have 750,000 Palestinians who have been ethnically cleansed from their homes who are now stateless. Since then, Israel has prevented them from returning to their homes, and at the same time blocked any moves towards an independent, sovereign and viable Palestinian state. In 1967, Israel invaded and occupied more territory, including the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the latter of which is the centre of Palestinian economic, religious and cultural life. It also fragmented the West Bank into separate areas cut off from each other and surrounded by new Israeli settlements, and cuts off Gaza from the rest of Palestine and the rest of the world more generally. \n\nSo the primary opposition to Israel these days tends to focus on the genocide in Gaza (obviously), and the occupation and oppression of Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. \n\n&gt;In 2005 they give Palestine gaza and what happens? Hamas uses it to build miles of tunnels and send hundreds or thousands of missiles to Israel. \n\nThis is a common misconception. Israel withdrew its settlers and soldiers from Gaza in 2005, but it didn't \"give Palestine Gaza\". It was still in effective control, so was still the occupying power according to international law and the leading international bodies. The leading expert on the political economy of Gaza is Sara Roy of Harvard, and her work showing how Israel deliberately 'de-developed' Gaza's economy during this period is required reading on this topic. \n\n&gt;What would you have done if you were Israel?\n\nThe obvious answer is \"not commit a genocide\", but I will expand on that a little. The key point is to understand the underlying cause and work to address it. Palestinian resistance has come in many forms, but at its heart its a fight against an occupying power who has expelled them from their homeland and rendered them a stateless people at the mercy of Israeli occupation and aggression. The solution is to take the difficult steps necessary to end the occupation and work towards living in peace. End the siege on Gaza and the illegal settlement expansion in the West Bank, and give equal rights and freedoms to Palestinians as Israeli Jews currently enjoy. It's a difficult process and it wouldn't solve everything overnight. But the current playbook is also untenable. It just reproduces a cycle of violence that will end with the extermination or expulsion of one group of people. We desperately need a new approach and new ideas, and that will take bravery and real leaders, not just politicians.",

By fighting for protections, laws and human rights. My own preferred resolution would be a single binational secular state where every inhabitant had equality under the law regardless of their race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, etc. You could have a specific legislature with representatives from each ethnicity, with any bill that affects a minority requiring a certain level of support from that minority's representatives, a constitution with human rights that requires a supermajority to change, a special legislative function for Jerusalem, etc.  There's a lot of creative ideas of how to achieve it - you look at other examples that have worked, learn from their mistakes, see what unique features Israel and Palestine would have, and fight to make it a reality.\n\n&gt;At the end of the day, Palestinians in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza are not citizens of Israel.

The Palestinians were never Egyptian,  even when Egypt occupied Gaza. Arabs aren't a monolith. Also, your description of the Nakba and subsequent wars leaves quite a lot to be desired.  Fundamentally, there's a group of people who are stateless and living under occupation, and that needs to end. You can disagree on whether it should end by way of a one state or a two state solution (though I think at this point, the notion of a viable two state solution is dead and buried), but you can't just pretend that Palestinians will suddenly become Jordanians or Egyptians and give up any claim to their homes.",

That's the UN and the surrounding Arab states position, but certainly not mine. \n\nI'd point out that the majority of them are recent Arabized immigrants and as such they don't have any significant ties to the land.

In this case, it just needs to be handled on a larger scale. \n\nFlatten the place end to end, keep the yellow line where it is and give the Arabs in Gaza an ultimatum, disarm or Israel will move forward to; in the North where the Yellow Line should be moved forward to at least the Netzarim Corridor and better yet to the Wadi Gaza and in the South to the Megan Oz Corridor.

A building built by the Jewish King Herod over the Tombs of the Abraham, Issac, Sarah, Rivkah and Jacob who became Israel. Later turned into a Mosque by the invading Arab armies. \n\nJews were only be allowed to go up to the 7th step as a sign of humiliation and inferiority to the Muslims.. Any Jew that passed the 7th step would be beaten and some even killed. This wasn't in the far past, this was happening until 1967. Only when the Jews defeated the Arabs, for the 1st time in 700 years they could walk past the 7th step.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cEDTMV8X8\n\n.\n\nJews were barred access to the temple mount, the holiest place in Judiasm.. not 3rd or 4th.. The holiest place to Jews thousands of years before Islam was even a thought.. since they could not gain access they prayed at the eastern wall instead.. \n\nArabs/Muslims didn't like the Jews praying there, so they placed a muslim cemetery at the eastern wall, both to stop Jews from praying there and prevent the return of the Jewish messiah who was supposed to enter the city from that side, they even blocked the gate. \n\nIt was only in the 1500's when an earthquake knocked a few buildings over near the western wall the ottomans allowed Jews a small section, about 30 feet wide to pray in, and that didn't last that long either with the Muslim community constantly attacking and killing Jews for praying there..\n\nJews would have to go and pray at time when no-one was there, since Arabs mobs would randomly beat Jews they found there.\n\n. \n\nAl-Qawuqji family.. in particular Fawzi. Fawzi served as a Colonel in the Nazi military. Later escaping to the mandate of Palestine at the end of the war.. His most famed quote \"*The battle between the Arabs and the Jews is a total battle, and the only possibility is the annihilation of every Jew in Palestine and all Arab countries*\".\n\nLater as leader of the ALA during the 1947-48 war, he decided to put his many calls to murder all Jews into actions, and was responsible for what would later be called acts of Genocide. His men had blocked all routes in and out of the Jewish sections of Jerusalem, proceeded to firebomb all food stores in the Jewish area, making sure no food can reach the 140,000+ Jewish civilians/inhabitants. \n\nHe then later ordered Cpt. Madlul Abbas to destroy the only spring/water supply to the Jewish quarter, leaving all the civilians without water or food. He also refused to allow Red Cross access to the blockaded Jewish quarter.  He then also setup snipers to shoot and kill any Jews that they saw walking the streets\n\nAs starvation set in, complaints from the Red cross and UN started to mount as well intentional pressure, eventually forcing King Abdullah to make a truce where international officials and the red cross could access Jerusalem. This was mainly triggeed after images and news of the conditions of the Jews in Jerusalem in the 7 month siege made their way to to international media. After this and several more atrocities made their way to international news, King Abdullah disbanded the ALA.\n\nThe end result of the war was the complete ethnic cleansing of over 140,000 Jews from Jerusalem, Hebron and other west bank towns, that with the previous ethnic cleansing of Jews from Gaza in the 1920's during the Arab riots made the Arabs 100% successful at ethnic cleansing all Jews from territories that they held at the end of the 48 war.\n\n.\n\nThe aftermath.. There were about 35 synagogue inside the walls of Jerusalem, most of them were built underground, because no Jewish synagogue was allowed to be above a Mosque. Eventually the ottomans allowed the Jews to build above the ground, so several larger and above ground ones were built in the mid 1800's.. then after the 48 war..\n\nhttps://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jordan-s-desecration-of-jerualem-1948-1967\n\n*All but one of the 35 synagogues within the Old City were destroyed; those not completely devastated had been used as hen houses and stables filled with dung-heaps, garbage. and carcasses. The revered Jewish graveyard on the Mount of Olives was in complete disarray with thousands of tombstones broken, some of which were used as building materials for roads and latrines. Large areas of the cemetery were leveled to provide a short-cut to a new hotel. Hundreds of Torah scrolls and thousands of holy books were plundered and burned to ashes*\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_of_Olives\n\n*some Arab residents uprooted tombstones and plowed the land in the cemeteries, and an estimated 38,000 tombstones were damaged in total. During this period, a road was paved through the cemetery, in the process destroying graves including those of famous persons. In 1964, the Intercontinental Hotel was built at the summit of the mount. Graves were also demolished for parking lots and a filling station and were used in latrines at a Jordanian Army barracks*\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Jewish_cemetery,_Hebron\n\n*During the Jordanian period (1948–1967), the cemetery was intentionally destroyed and the site was cultivated by Arab residents for growing produce. Around 4,000 tombstones were removed and used for construction purposes*\n\n\n.\n\nDirect quotes from Fawzi al-Qawuqji Memoirs..\n\n\"*These reports also indicated that the fires caused by our bombardment of Jewish installations had burnt down many of their provision stores, that the Jews were in utter despair*\"\n\n\"*the Jewish areas depended entirely on water from the Ras al-Ain position, while the Arabs could use the wells in the old city. I therefore cabled to Captain Madlul Abbas, the Commander of the Hattin Battalion, telling him without delay to cut off the water at the springs, which were in his area.*\"",

Including the most heinous of violations of international law (hostage taking of toddlers, Extermination, Genocide), or their proud, longstanding, primary strategy of either openly indiscriminate attacks, or outright targeting Israeli Jewish civilians, without any attempt to pretend to be targeting lawful targets. Or their a systematic, more or less universal abuse of international law for cover for their illegal military activities (Perfidy, Human Shields), that are the direct, intentional reason for the heavy death toll and destruction on *their own* side. And from an ad bellum perspective, the completely illegal, openly stated goal of conquering the state of Israel and annexing it to Palestine, followed by stripping the Israeli Jews of their inalienable right of self determination at best, and complete destruction of the Israeli Jews at worst.\n\nUnlike Israel, Hamas/PIJ don't even pretend to follow the LOAC or IHL, have no equivalent of the Israeli MAG, military courts, or the IAF legal advisors for every strike, any judicial review of international law violations by Gazan courts (which, to be clear, did exist), or anything else that would even remotely seem like a desire to comply with international law. And if anything, the Hamas government loudly praise and reward the most criminal of behaviors by their members, if they don't simply order it outright, while making slick propaganda videos boasting about their systematic, unquestionable criminality.\n\nFinally, as OP correctly pointed out, the fact any Gazan civilians were killed at all in this particular conflict, and any Gazan homes were destroyed, is a direct result of criminal choices made by Hamas, and forced on the Israelis against their will. The choice to start this war of aggression to begin with, by invading Israel and committing Genocide (or at the very least Extermination, hostage taking, gang-rape-executions etc.) in peaceful Israeli Jewish communities. The choice to illegally place their entire war machine under and inside people's homes, schools, hospitals, mosques and other civilian objects, and while refusing to wear any distinguishing marks while fighting (as opposed to revolting parades of hostages, for example), and generally building their entire defensive strategy on abusing international law and maximizing their own civilian casualties. Finally, they made the choice to not end the war for two years, by refusing to comply with their legal requirement to immediately and unconditionally release all of their hostages, and stand trial of their crimes - or even accept the generous pardon and exile that the Israelis offered them.\n\nAnd of course, the far more nuanced violations of international law by Israel, simply cannot absolve Hamas of their legal responsibilities, both to Israelis and their own population.\n\nThe fact is, from the perspective of international law, this is still very much a \"both sides\" issue - with the Palestinian side being significantly worse, on every imaginable level. OP talked about a \"middle road\", and your attempt to swerve hard into the \"but Israel is bad\" side, is simply not justifiable.",

    "body": "Again, both sides violated international law in various ways. The Palestinian violations are more severe, more blatant, and more systematic. With essentially no attempt whatsoever to follow international law, nothing that comes even close to the Israeli attempts to do so (however deficient you mind find them). And if anything, the Palestinians have a longstanding strategic policy to completely flaunt any obligations they might have under IHL (and international law period), only taking note of IHL when they intentionally abuse it, and this policy forms the core of their military strategy.  And when talking about the recent Gaza conflict, the Palestinian criminal choices are the main driving force behind the suffering and death inflicted on both Gazans and Israelis. So again, trying to take OP's argument about the \"middle road\", and swerving hard into \"Israel is evil\", *especially* if you justify it with \"no middle road when it comes to legal obligations\", is just not justifiable or \"serious\", on any level.\n\nAs for the second paragraph, what's fundamentally \"unserious\" is your engagement with my argument, or rather, refusal to engage with it. If Hamas didn't start this illegal war of aggression, and didn't illegally enmesh themselves within their civilian population, considerations like the proportionality of strikes on civilian objects wouldn't even come into play. Once the Palestinians did make that set of intentional, fundamental criminal choices, it's not impossible, but certainly much, much harder for Israel to pursue their legitimate war aims legally. And it's basically impossible for them to do so, without people like you simply declaring any attack that \"foreseeably killed civilians\" is automatically disproportional, a war crime, and possibly even equivalent to the widespread and systematic Palestinian practice of intentionally targeting civilians, based on the little skewed information they get from the media.\n\nThat's not a coincidence. That's literally the point. The reason why Hamas invested so much effort and money into their criminal strategy of human shielding and perfidy.  You don't get to ignore that, and wave it off with \"who cares, let's talk about Israeli legal obligations instead\".",

Do you think Israelis still believe in peace after the intifadas and the endless attacks from Gaza and the West Bank? Naturally, public opinion has shifted. Peace now seems delusional and far-fetched, but I still think the Israeli side is willing to compromise for it.
