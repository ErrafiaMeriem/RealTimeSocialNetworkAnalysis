Gaza is almost pacified so give it another year maybe and they'll be completely disarmed. Send in the wheel excavators and they could have the ground scrubbed of unexploded munitions and tunnels in less than another year. Start with a nice flat clean slate and some nice new tents, eliminate the antagonists like the UN and hamas and Gaza, in a generation or so might be ready for an easing of restrictions, who knows, I guess it depends on them if they want to live in peace or not. \n\nGiving up the settlements isn't going to happen, again nothing in it for Israel. Asking Israel to pay reparations is nuts, they didn't start it, speaking of which, the Israeli's are still owed reparations from when they were thrown out of all those Arab nations, and particularly in the West Bank by Jordan and in the Old Trans-Jordon. In the end reparations work out more in favor of Israel than the Arabs in the mandate area. Again, nothing in it for Israel. \n\nMy two cents is that plan would never work. I think a better plan would be for Gaza to voluntarily disarm immediately and peacefully evacuate all areas behind the yellow line as penance for the atrocities of 10/7. Surrender all hamas members to the Israeli army within 30 days or face consequences. \n\nThe West Bank is a whole other can of worms. \n\nAnyway its great that folks are trying to come up with solutions but its got to be equitable and it must take into consideration that Israel has been forced to defend itself from day one and has no reason to lift restrictions. Trust is something you gain over time and so far its been one terrorist act after another so, Israel has no incentive to lift restrictions. \n\nMy two cents   \nCheers.",

So might as well deal with it all at once and dig up the tunnels while your at it.  \nHere's my plan\n\nI'm sure the plan could be improved but the nuts and bolts are there.\n\nIsrael should take the coastline in Gaza, its a huge smuggling risk and if the Gazan's aren't going to willingly disarm then its a must. Say a one mile buffer zone between the water and the Arabs. Two would be better. Extend the Yellow line to the Wadi Gaza and take the coast along the entire strip. That'd pin hamas in a manageable area with no chance of importing any more weapons.\n\nThe order of operations should be something like.\n\n1. Evacuate all civilians south of the Wadi Gaza but within the current yellow line to the north.\n2. Wheel excavators sift and flatten the area within the yellow line south of the Wadi Gaza down to a depth of about 50 meters.\n3. evacuate all civilians north of the Wadi Gaza back to the south and within the existing yellow line except for a new buffer zone along the coast one mile deep.\n4. The new yellow line is moved forward to the Wadi Gaza taking an additional 25% or so of Gaza in reparations for failing to disarm and the atrocities of 10/7.\n5. wheel excavators flatten the area north of the Wadi Gaza.\n6. wheel excavators move on to flatten the remaining areas controlled by Israel behind the yellow line.\n\nResult.  \n7) All of Gaza is now cleared of unexploded munitions and buildings intact or otherwise, all rubble has been removed for recycling and use outside of Gaza. No salvageable building materials should be left within Gaza. Gaza is flat as a pancake ready to rebuild when conditions are met.  \n8) Hamas is now contained in an area of about 30 square miles of flat gravel sifted of any and all building materials and tunnels down to a depth of about 50 meters.  \n9) set up a 28 square mile refugee tent city and a 2 square mile POW camp.  \n10) Review and register all as they come to the aid stations within the new camp and place them accordingly.  \n11) Aid stations and resources should be controlled and operated by the IDF and all recipients certified as legit refugees.  \n12) The cost of clearing Gaza and operating the refugee camp should come out of the Gaza reconstruction fund or UN funds with the IDF being compensated for its participation. No NGOs should be allowed to participate.  \n13) POW camps should be run and funded in accordance with the Geneva Conventions  \n14) No reconstruction should begin until a period of ten years has passed without incident.\n\nIn the end you've created a legit refugee camp devoid of combatants and antagonistic influences and segregated the belligerents in the accordance with the Geneva conventions. Let the peace process begin. In a decade or so, reconstruction could begin as long as the refugees remain peaceful and build some trust with their Israeli neighbors first. \n\nThe problem thus far is that the UN refused to segregate combatants from non combatants and instead, actively supported their employ within the UN, thus subverting the entire goal of peace between the two parties.\n\nIsrael will need to start over with a clean slate in order to re educate the civilian population while incarcerating the radicals in the POW camp. POWs will need to remain incarcerated until deportations arrangements can be made.\n\nEmigration by the refugees should be immediately allowed to anywhere outside of the mandate area.\n\nThe solution is simple, confine the problem to a smaller and smaller areas and limit the risks through proper preparation of the site, which in this case means flattening all of Gaza. Those huge wheel excavators could handle it in no time. Less than a year depending on how many you have. I'd. say a half dozen of the Bagger wheel excavators would do the job in less than a year.\n\nCheers",

Even Egypt is terrified of the Gazans, and other Arab states are also less-than-enamored of them. I don't think Israel's population would ever accept a population inflow like that. What you're describing is a type of \"right of return,\" and Israel doesn't have much interest in that. \n\nI also think the Palestinians on the West Bank would be loathe to approve an agreement that rewards the Gazans, but not them. In other words, what you're describing is an agreement by which Gazans can potentially live in Israel (and thereby attempt to reclaim their lost property there), while the West Bank population would not have a similar right. Given the divide between Gaza and the West Bank politically, I doubt the former would agree to this. I may be wrong though -- who knows? \n\nYou're trying to achieve a balance of taking-and-giving to make things fair--however, for both sides, most of what you're describing crosses important \"red lines\" that are unacceptable to each party. This, of course, is why the conflict persists. There's no real middle ground in this conflict. The Israelis don't want to give up land. The Palestinians won't give up their land claims or their \"right of return.\" \n\nAlso -- I'm not Jewish or Israeli -- but I know for a fact the Israelis will never accept a return to a divided Jerusalem. Partial withdrawal from the West Bank is imaginable. That could happen -- it's not impossible. It's been part of previous peace proposals. But I think Jerusalem is off the table for them.",

And Israeli citizenship is not a booby prize for losing a war with Israel. I do not want former Hamas or PIJ personnel and their families moving into Tel Aviv, or Haifa, or Qiryat Shmoneh.\n\nFurthermore, 80% of West bank settlers live close to the Green line in settlement blocs that can easily be exchanged with Israel. There is no need to relocate all of them. That's an unreasonable ask.\n\nWhat is more, besides E Jerusalem, all of the West Bank remains unannexed. So your distinction between \"unannexed\" and \"annexed\" doesn't make sense.\n\nAdditionally, the Israeli concern with Palestinian statehood now in the West Bank is that such a state without Israeli military presence may be used as a launch pad for attacks against Israel, like South Lebanon and Gaza were used. However, the West Bank is on Jerusalem's municipal border and just a few km from Tel Aviv and Ben Gurion airport, on higher ground. This plan does not address this security risk at all. There are no security guarantees. You demand that Palestine \"demilitarize\", but without the IDF there to ensure that, who is there to enforce it.\n\nNor are there any institutional demands on the Palestinians for statehood. The Palestinian national movement for a century has spent very little of its effort developing effective institutions for statehood. There are no requirements for Palestinians to develop effective state institutions. The current PA is weak and ineffective, and institutions are weak. Without strong state institutions, the Palestinian state is likely to devolve into conflict, which will inevitably used as an excuse to attack Israel, unless this piece is taken seriously.\n\nFinally, there is no demand of Palestinians to give up ideology of opposition to Israel and annihilation of the Jewish state. So long as that is the national ideology of Palestine, the result will be the same. This ideology is not \"radical\" in Palestinian society, but mainstream. Without a plan to deradicalize and actually have Palestinian society accept that Jews are not foreigners and Israel but belong there, and have a right to self determination, then we haven't moved an inch.",

His views changed in the letter to Nehru as you quoted.\n\nHe said in a 1938 speech:\n\n&gt; I should much rather see reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of living together in peace than the creation of a Jewish state. My awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists the idea of a Jewish state with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power, no matter how modest. I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustain—especially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our own ranks, against which we have already had to fight strongly, even without a Jewish state. ... If external necessity should after all compel us to assume this burden, let us bear it with tact and patience.\n\nAfter independence, he supported Israel but was critical of the violence that was inflicted to achieve it. (That's a sensible take).\n\n---\n\nEinstein's discourse on Zionism is as a means to right the wrongs done to Jews in Europe and to demand their own homeland as others had. I think it notably lacks mention of the injustices that were to be done and later done to the Palestinians. That's important because those injustices, known globally in retrospect, are the core of the Palestinian issue.\n\nHis statements are not egregious or unexpected.

However, they have never stated to conquer the entire Middle East, or Palestine.\n\nThere are many issues with your post but this conclusion you came to is just flat out false, since you brought up Ben Gurion for instance:\n\n\"Does the establishment of a Jewish state \\[in only part of Palestine\\] advance or retard the conversion of this country into a Jewish country? My assumption (which is why I am a fervent proponent of a state, even though it is now linked to partition) is that a Jewish state on only part of the land is not the end but the beginning. This is because this increase in possession is of consequence not only in itself, but because through it we increase our strength, and **every increase in strength helps in the possession of the land as a whole.** The establishment of a state, even if only on a portion of the land, is the maximal reinforcement of our strength at the present time and a powerful boost to our historical endeavors to liberate the entire country.\" \\[9\\]  \n([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937\\_Ben-Gurion\\_letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937_Ben-Gurion_letter))\n\nYou go over a portion of this letter in your post so it's strange you didn't actually examine it in its totality, as you were complaining about others not doing.\n\n...\n\n\"Weizmann and Ben-Gurion pressed for a solution based on partition. Said Weizmann: 'The Jews would be fools not to accept it, even if \\[the land they were allocated\\] were the size of a table cloth.' Both saw partition as a stepping stone to further expansion and the eventual takeover of the whole of Palestine. **'No Zionist can forgo the smallest portion of the Land of Israel,'** Ben-Gurion was quoted as saying.\"  \n([https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr\\_0/page/138/mode/2up?q=stepping+stone](https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr_0/page/138/mode/2up?q=stepping+stone))\n\n...\n\n\"It might be noted that the “boundaries of Zionist aspirations” in Ben Gurion’s “vision” were quite broad, including southern Lebanon, southern Syria, today’s Jordan, all of cis-Jordan, and the Sinai. This was, in fact, one of Ben-Gurion’s constant themes. In internal discussion in 1938, he stated that **“after we become a strong force, as the result of the creation of a state, we shall abolish partition and expand to the whole of Palestine. The state will only be a stage in the realization of Zionism and its task is to prepare the ground for our expansion into the whole of Palestine by a Jewish-Arab agreement. The state will have to preserve order not only by preaching morality but by machine guns, if necessary.”**\n\nThe “agreement” that Ben-Gurion had in mind was to be with King Abdullah of Jordan, who would be induced to cede areas of cis-Jordan under his control, while many of the Arab residents would leave. Earlier, **Ben-Gurion had explained to Arab interlocutors that “our land” included Transjordan, and that it extended from the Sinai to “the source of the Jordan.”** In internal discussion he urged that “we do not suggest now to announce the final aim,” which is “far-reaching,” even more so than the aim of those who were opposing partition. “I am unwilling to abandon the great Jewish vision, the final vision,” he added. This vision, here unspecified in scale, “is an organic, spiritual and ideological component of my Jewishness and my Zionist aspiration,” Ben-Gurion explained.\"  \n([https://archive.org/details/NoamChomskyFatefulTriangleF/page/n287/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/NoamChomskyFatefulTriangleF/page/n287/mode/2up))\n\n...\n\n\"Although the Jewish Agency accepted the partition plan, it did not accept the proposed borders as final and Israel's declaration of independence avoided the mention of any boundaries. A state in part of Palestine was seen as a stage towards a larger state when opportunity allowed. Although the borders were “bad from a military and political point of view,” **Ben Gurion urged fellow Jews to accept the UN Partition Plan, pointing out that arrangements are never final, “not with regard to the regime, not with regard to borders, and not with regard to international agreements.”**\n\nThe idea of partition being a temporary expedient dated back to the Peel Partition proposal of 1937. When the Zionist Congress had rejected partition on the grounds that the Jews had an inalienable right to settle anywhere in Palestine, **Ben Gurion had argued in favour of acceptance: “I see in the realisation of this plan practically the decisive stage in the beginning of full redemption and the most wonderful lever for the gradual conquest of all of Palestine.”**  \n([https://archive.org/details/palestineisraelu0000mcdo/mode/2up?q=full+redemption](https://archive.org/details/palestineisraelu0000mcdo/mode/2up?q=full+redemption))\n\n“After the formation of a large army in the wake of the establishment of the state, we will abolish partition and expand to the whole of Palestine.”  \n— Ben Gurion, p. 22, *The Birth of Israel* (1987), Simha Flapan.\n\n“If it was permissible to move an Arab from the Galilee to Judea, why it is impossible to move an Arab from Hebron to Transjordan, which is much closer? There are vast expanses of land there and we are overcrowded. Even the High Commission agrees to a transfer to Transjordan if we equip the peasants with land and money. If the Peel Commission and the London Government accept, we’ll remove the land problem from the agenda.”",

We must accept this fact with love and draw all the necessary conclusions from it. This constitutes the basis for a genuine understanding between us and the Arabs.” \nBen-Gurion at Labor Conference, quoted in Mendes-Flohr, *A Land of Two Peoples: Martin Buber on Jews and Arabs*, University of Chicago Press, 1983, p. 6.\n\nWalter Laqueur writes in *A History of Zionism* (1972) that the idea of population transfer was never Zionist policy and “Ben-Gurion emphatically rejected it, saying that even if Jews were given the right to evict Arabs they would not make use of it” (p. 232). Laqueur has more along these lines on Ben-Gurion and other Zionist leaders in this same chapter I can add to later, as well as other authors. \n\nEdit: See also Anita Shapira on Ben-Gurion’s crucial decision regarding the West Bank in 1948 war (*Ben Gurion: Father of Modern Israel*, Yale University Press, 1971, p. 173). I believe Benny Morris covers that decision in *1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War* (2008) as well on p. 386 (“urging Ben-Gurion to order the conquest of the West Bank”).",

He also says later in his testimony:\n\nThis is a very misleading reading of Ben Gurion's testimony. Yes, he was not in favor of a bi-national state. But that doesn't mean partition was his favored solution. What he wanted was to establish some sort of trusteeship over the territory, which would allow for large scale Jewish immigration, before establishing a Jewish state in the entirety of Palestine. This was necessary because a democracy could not be established without a Jewish majority.\n\n&gt;CHAIRMAN: On the other hand, we see that you want the abolition of the Mandate and you do not want the substitution of a trusteeship, or something of that kind, for the Mandate. Then the question must come up: how do you think that immigration could be implemented if the Mandate has ceased? What kind of government do you think should be established in this country instead of the Mandate?\n\n&gt;Mr. BEN GURION: Well, that is a very legitimate question, and a very sensible question, and I will try to answer you to the best of my ability. We say that the White Paper policy is illegal, and therefore, it should be removed at once. The Mandate, in fact, does not exist because it was violated by the Mandatory. We are not in favour of renewing it. We do not believe that in the future it will be carried out better than in the past. Therefore, we say that the original intention and the need, and what in our conviction is just, should be decided upon by the United Nations, and a Jewish State should be established.\n\n&gt;There are two parts in the establishment of a state: one is the material part, which is the most essential; the other is the legal part, the purely formal one, which is also of great importance.\n\n&gt;I will say a word about the material establishment, because the whole difficulty of the problem here is that you have a people, you have a country, and their right to the country was acknowledged, but the people do not happen to be there yet. They were dispossessed, and they have to come back. So, the first thing is the material establishment of the state, which means that plans based on our experience and on achievements, examined and approved by experts-economic, irrigation, agricultural, industrial experts, and so on-should be examined by the Committee and the United Nations to see how they can be carried out; and that a million Jews should be resettled in their country.\n\n&gt;In our view it is not only possible, but it is possible to do so by good will. It is possible to do it in a very short time. This is the material establishment of a national home for the Jewish State. This may take some time. In the meantime, it will be supervised by the highest authority of the United Nations. The fact that the Mandatory itself referred it to the United Nations implies a certain recognition that this is the place where it has to be judged and de, decided, although the Mandatory did not undertake formally to carry it out. But there is an indication that this is the place where it should be decided.\n\n&gt;Assuming that on the recommendations of your Committee the United Nations approves of that plan, the material establishment, it means the settlement of the first million Jews I say a million, it may be 900,000 or it may be 1,100,000, to state a round figure-in the shortest possible time. Even the shortest possible time may and must take some time. I am unable to say how long it will take. I think no one is able to say that, because there are always in human affairs unforeseen things which may happen. But it should not take longer, as far as w.e can judge now-it must not take longer than a few years. Not necessarily longer than a few years. Then, in the meantime, a committee, or any instrument which the United Nations will decide on, will supervise.\n\nQuotes continued in comment below",

When the United Nations will see that the main purpose for which, this country is destined, to solve the Jewish problem, that the main thing has been done and that the time is ripe to undertake administration of the Government itself, then the second phase, the legal, the formal establishment of a state will be reached. **Whether it will take two years or three years, I cannot say, but in that transition period it will be in charge of the United Nations. That is all we envisage here.**  \n  \n  \nCHAIRMAN: Let us assume that there would be violent resistance to enforcing the immigration, would you mean, in any circumstances, to go on and fight down the resistance?\n\n&gt;Mr. BEN GURION: I said we do not ask for a Mandate any more, so it is not a question. The question does not arise on the Mandate. But my answer to the question is, you have to decide whether what we ask is right or wrong. If it is right, and force is necessary, you have to apply it. If it is wrong, not only you do not have to apply force, but you do not have to allow it. It is a question of right and wrong, and not whether to apply or not to apply force, as in any other conflict in the world. And this is the reason the United Nations was established.\n\n&gt;Mr. RAND   (Canada):  I suppose that is one case in which you can resort to absolutes.\n\n&gt;Mr. BEN GURION: No absolutes. This was the reason why we were ready in 1937 I mean the majority-to consider a compromise. **Although we knew we were entitled to an entire country, when the British Government came and told us the result of that Commission, they said, you are right, but this will require force and we do not want it and we cannot do it, and therefore we tell you here is a compromise.

Condoms are actually a good one because many people are actually not aware of how to properly store condoms, how to properly apply, how to tell if the condom breaks and what to do if it does. But condoms, if used perfectly, has a 98% success rate for pregnancy and an effective rate of 85-87% because of the above issues. That means that out of 100 people all using condoms you can expect every year 15-17 of them will have a baby. Actually it’s probably higher as it obviously can count how many women got pregnant but it does as a zygote or morula or blastocyst and such. The numbers would be lower if the Pill was also used then it would be lower. However, I don’t know how much access they have to the Pill or condoms. I can’t imagine the refugee camps are full of condoms when they are focusing on food.",

It's true, they're still pumping 'em out far above the international average, but we must remember that this average is falling both the world over and of course within Palestinian society within and outside the territories. For Palestinians within Israel and the territories the fertility rate used to be around 9, which was an \\*eye-watering\\* number. The immediate diaspora was probably similar, given their rate of growth. Still, it's down to either half that or in some cases approaching a more a \"western\" rate, depending on where you look and who you look at. \n\nNow, we don't really have the data necessary to make an accurate assessment of how the present stage of the conflict will affect fertility rates either now (reported births are reportedly down 41%, but \"recorded births\" is the operative phrase here) or within the next few years. However, we can make some ballpark speculation and assume it'll probably go up. Access to healthcare was a \\*big\\* reason for the global drop in fertility over the 20th century, since it upended one of the main reasons for pumping out kids, which was general childhood mortality. Well, the healthcare system is in ruins and will probably remain so for at least a few years. And the natural human response to increased childhood mortality, as we've seen the world over, is really just \"keep on pumpin' \". Y'know, roll the dice, if you make more well then at least a couple of em might make it to adulthood. That'll probably lead to a brief explosion in fertility if healthcare is rebuilt rapidly, as was the case with the 20th century expansion of healthcare infrastructure, which should of course occur for moral reasons but even so one must acknowledge what can also occur alongside.",

In it, she asked her followers for recommendations for bagels in New York, specifying, “I don’t want to be giving any of my money to genocidal maniacs,” and adding that she was looking for shops that are either “actively pro-Palestinian” or “known to not be in support of that hell-hole place and Zionism” – clearly seeking to avoid Jewish-owned stores.\"\n\n\"On October 17, 2023, in response to an explosion outside the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, Save the Children’s Country Director for the West Bank and Gaza Jason Lee said stated, “Our worst fears are being realized. We’re seeing schools and hospitals – places of safety and sanctuary – being targeted. Civilian infrastructure like hospitals and schools must be protected at all times.” Lee ignored the videos, images, and intelligence materials demonstrating that an Islamic Jihad rocket had “misfired” (i.e. detonated in Gaza instead of Israel) and hit the hospital parking lot.\"\n\n\"In October 2020, Save the Children published a report on “the impact of the Israeli military detention system on Palestinian children.” Save the Children itself acknowledged that the data presented in the publication “is not a statistically significant or representative sample. As the report intentionally presents children’s experience from their own perspective, it is also important to note that incidents they mention have not been independently verified by Save the Children”. The report severely downplays the extent and severity of violence committed by Palestinian minors against Israeli civilians and soldiers, and ignores the widespread phenomena of incitement prevalent in the West Bank.\"\n\n\n\"In November 2018, during the violence on the Gaza border, Save the Children stated that “The Israeli government must end the use of sniper fire and live ammunition against children in Gaza. The killing and wounding of children is never acceptable.” Save the Children does not question why these children were present in an obviously violent situation where there was a known potential for injury, nor does the organization condemn Hamas and other Palestinian terror groups’ recruitment and use of children throughout the violence. The NGO also ignored the violent nature of the protests, which have consisted of an organized armed attack on the Israeli border and IDF positions, attempts to destroy and breach the border fence, and sustained arson, rocket, and mortar attacks on Israeli civilian communities.\"\n\n\n\"On May 18, 2018, Save the Children and the Palestinian Center for Democracy and Conflict Resolution sponsored a workshop at the Dar al Huda kindergarten, “Training of Teachers on Positive Discipline in Everyday Teaching.”\nOn May 26, 2018, the Dar al Huda kindergarten in Gaza held a graduation ceremony that included the mock killing and kidnapping of Israelis by children dressed as combatants.1 The simulation included sophisticated equipment such as drones, body cameras, military fatigues, body armor, and sniper camouflage. Children wore headbands representing Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), designated as a terrorist organization by the US, EU, and others.\"\n\n\n\"During the 2014 Gaza conflict, Save the Children published a full-page advertisement in papers throughout the UK of the names of Palestinian children who were killed; a similar list of Israeli children was not produced.\"\n\n\n\"Save the Children has repeatedly joined in the demonization campaign falsely accusing Israel of employing starvation as a method of warfare against Hamas. These allegations have been repeatedly shown to be based on fundamental methodological errors and overwhelmingly disproven by publicly available information.\"",

Attacks occurred at various locations, including shopping centers, public buses, transit stations, cafes, nightclubs, and restaurants, According to a 2006 study from the University of Haifa, only a few of the bombings targeted military objectives.

It's important to note that Hamas used to operate with much less of a budget, but thrived because of the failures of the government it contended against.

The former is newer but the latter has been an ol' tried-and-true since before Iranian money entered the fray, and one for which over decades nobody managed to find a way to deal with. There's a funny episode around the winding down the second intifada where PA forces in Gaza were raiding a lot of these charities diverting funds to Hamas with gusto, but it was backfiring hard (they were still at the end of the day charities doing charitable stuff) and then the solution that was decided was \"do nothing\".\n\nA thing with this is it was \"relatively\" well known before the present stage of the conflict, leaders up to Haniyeh himself would give interviews saying \"yes, we get Iranian money\" on the reg and articles reporting Hamas getting more Iran money would be published without much controversy.",

Gaza is almost pacified so give it another year maybe and they'll be completely disarmed. Send in the wheel excavators and they could have the ground scrubbed of unexploded munitions and tunnels in less than another year. Start with a nice flat clean slate and some nice new tents, eliminate the antagonists like the UN and hamas and Gaza, in a generation or so might be ready for an easing of restrictions, who knows, I guess it depends on them if they want to live in peace or not. \n\nGiving up the settlements isn't going to happen, again nothing in it for Israel. Asking Israel to pay reparations is nuts, they didn't start it, speaking of which, the Israeli's are still owed reparations from when they were thrown out of all those Arab nations, and particularly in the West Bank by Jordan and in the Old Trans-Jordon. In the end reparations work out more in favor of Israel than the Arabs in the mandate area. Again, nothing in it for Israel. \n\nMy two cents is that plan would never work. I think a better plan would be for Gaza to voluntarily disarm immediately and peacefully evacuate all areas behind the yellow line as penance for the atrocities of 10/7. Surrender all hamas members to the Israeli army within 30 days or face consequences. \n\nThe West Bank is a whole other can of worms. \n\nAnyway its great that folks are trying to come up with solutions but its got to be equitable and it must take into consideration that Israel has been forced to defend itself from day one and has no reason to lift restrictions. Trust is something you gain over time and so far its been one terrorist act after another so, Israel has no incentive to lift restrictions. \n\nMy two cents   \nCheers.",

So might as well deal with it all at once and dig up the tunnels while your at it.  \nHere's my plan\n\nI'm sure the plan could be improved but the nuts and bolts are there.\n\nIsrael should take the coastline in Gaza, its a huge smuggling risk and if the Gazan's aren't going to willingly disarm then its a must. Say a one mile buffer zone between the water and the Arabs. Two would be better. Extend the Yellow line to the Wadi Gaza and take the coast along the entire strip. That'd pin hamas in a manageable area with no chance of importing any more weapons.\n\nThe order of operations should be something like.\n\n1. Evacuate all civilians south of the Wadi Gaza but within the current yellow line to the north.\n2. Wheel excavators sift and flatten the area within the yellow line south of the Wadi Gaza down to a depth of about 50 meters.\n3. evacuate all civilians north of the Wadi Gaza back to the south and within the existing yellow line except for a new buffer zone along the coast one mile deep.\n4. The new yellow line is moved forward to the Wadi Gaza taking an additional 25% or so of Gaza in reparations for failing to disarm and the atrocities of 10/7.\n5. wheel excavators flatten the area north of the Wadi Gaza.\n6. wheel excavators move on to flatten the remaining areas controlled by Israel behind the yellow line.\n\nResult.  \n7) All of Gaza is now cleared of unexploded munitions and buildings intact or otherwise, all rubble has been removed for recycling and use outside of Gaza. No salvageable building materials should be left within Gaza. Gaza is flat as a pancake ready to rebuild when conditions are met.  \n8) Hamas is now contained in an area of about 30 square miles of flat gravel sifted of any and all building materials and tunnels down to a depth of about 50 meters.  \n9) set up a 28 square mile refugee tent city and a 2 square mile POW camp.  \n10) Review and register all as they come to the aid stations within the new camp and place them accordingly.  \n11) Aid stations and resources should be controlled and operated by the IDF and all recipients certified as legit refugees.  \n12) The cost of clearing Gaza and operating the refugee camp should come out of the Gaza reconstruction fund or UN funds with the IDF being compensated for its participation. No NGOs should be allowed to participate.  \n13) POW camps should be run and funded in accordance with the Geneva Conventions  \n14) No reconstruction should begin until a period of ten years has passed without incident.\n\nIn the end you've created a legit refugee camp devoid of combatants and antagonistic influences and segregated the belligerents in the accordance with the Geneva conventions. Let the peace process begin. In a decade or so, reconstruction could begin as long as the refugees remain peaceful and build some trust with their Israeli neighbors first. \n\nThe problem thus far is that the UN refused to segregate combatants from non combatants and instead, actively supported their employ within the UN, thus subverting the entire goal of peace between the two parties.\n\nIsrael will need to start over with a clean slate in order to re educate the civilian population while incarcerating the radicals in the POW camp. POWs will need to remain incarcerated until deportations arrangements can be made.\n\nEmigration by the refugees should be immediately allowed to anywhere outside of the mandate area.\n\nThe solution is simple, confine the problem to a smaller and smaller areas and limit the risks through proper preparation of the site, which in this case means flattening all of Gaza. Those huge wheel excavators could handle it in no time. Less than a year depending on how many you have. I'd. say a half dozen of the Bagger wheel excavators would do the job in less than a year.\n\nCheers",

Given the divide between Gaza and the West Bank politically, I doubt the former would agree to this. I may be wrong though -- who knows? \n\nYou're trying to achieve a balance of taking-and-giving to make things fair--however, for both sides, most of what you're describing crosses important \"red lines\" that are unacceptable to each party.

    "body": "Israel withdrew from Gaza and, with the exception of a small sector of Israeli society, is not interested in Gaza. And Israeli citizenship is not a booby prize for losing a war with Israel. I do not want former Hamas or PIJ personnel and their families moving into Tel Aviv, or Haifa, or Qiryat Shmoneh.\n\nFurthermore, 80% of West bank settlers live close to the Green line in settlement blocs that can easily be exchanged with Israel. There is no need to relocate all of them. That's an unreasonable ask.\n\nWhat is more, besides E Jerusalem, all of the West Bank remains unannexed. So your distinction between \"unannexed\" and \"annexed\" doesn't make sense.\n\nAdditionally, the Israeli concern with Palestinian statehood now in the West Bank is that such a state without Israeli military presence may be used as a launch pad for attacks against Israel, like South Lebanon and Gaza were used. However, the West Bank is on Jerusalem's municipal border and just a few km from Tel Aviv and Ben Gurion airport, on higher ground. This plan does not address this security risk at all. There are no security guarantees. You demand that Palestine \"demilitarize\", but without the IDF there to ensure that, who is there to enforce it.\n\nNor are there any institutional demands on the Palestinians for statehood. The Palestinian national movement for a century has spent very little of its effort developing effective institutions for statehood. There are no requirements for Palestinians to develop effective state institutions. The current PA is weak and ineffective, and institutions are weak. Without strong state institutions, the Palestinian state is likely to devolve into conflict, which will inevitably used as an excuse to attack Israel, unless this piece is taken seriously.\n\nFinally, there is no demand of Palestinians to give up ideology of opposition to Israel and annihilation of the Jewish state. So long as that is the national ideology of Palestine, the result will be the same. This ideology is not \"radical\" in Palestinian society, but mainstream. Without a plan to deradicalize and actually have Palestinian society accept that Jews are not foreigners and Israel but belong there, and have a right to self determination, then we haven't moved an inch.",

I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustain—especially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our own ranks, against which we have already had to fight strongly, even without a Jewish state. ... If external necessity should after all compel us to assume this burden, let us bear it with tact and patience.\n\nAfter independence, he supported Israel but was critical of the violence that was inflicted to achieve it. (That's a sensible take).\n\n---\n\nEinstein's discourse on Zionism is as a means to right the wrongs done to Jews in Europe and to demand their own homeland as others had. I think it notably lacks mention of the injustices that were to be done and later done to the Palestinians. That's important because those injustices, known globally in retrospect, are the core of the Palestinian issue.\n\nHis statements are not egregious or unexpected.

    "body": "&gt;There is no doubt that Zionist leaders were clearly interested in getting more land in the partition. However, they have never stated to conquer the entire Middle East, or Palestine.\n\nThere are many issues with your post but this conclusion you came to is just flat out false, since you brought up Ben Gurion for instance:\n\n\"Does the establishment of a Jewish state \\[in only part of Palestine\\] advance or retard the conversion of this country into a Jewish country? My assumption (which is why I am a fervent proponent of a state, even though it is now linked to partition) is that a Jewish state on only part of the land is not the end but the beginning. This is because this increase in possession is of consequence not only in itself, but because through it we increase our strength, and **every increase in strength helps in the possession of the land as a whole.** The establishment of a state, even if only on a portion of the land, is the maximal reinforcement of our strength at the present time and a powerful boost to our historical endeavors to liberate the entire country.\" \\[9\\]  \n([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937\\_Ben-Gurion\\_letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937_Ben-Gurion_letter))\n\nYou go over a portion of this letter in your post so it's strange you didn't actually examine it in its totality, as you were complaining about others not doing.\n\n...\n\n\"Weizmann and Ben-Gurion pressed for a solution based on partition. Said Weizmann: 'The Jews would be fools not to accept it, even if \\[the land they were allocated\\] were the size of a table cloth.' Both saw partition as a stepping stone to further expansion and the eventual takeover of the whole of Palestine. **'No Zionist can forgo the smallest portion of the Land of Israel,'** Ben-Gurion was quoted as saying.\"  \n([https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr\\_0/page/138/mode/2up?q=stepping+stone](https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr_0/page/138/mode/2up?q=stepping+stone))\n\n...\n\n\"It might be noted that the “boundaries of Zionist aspirations” in Ben Gurion’s “vision” were quite broad, including southern Lebanon, southern Syria, today’s Jordan, all of cis-Jordan, and the Sinai. This was, in fact, one of Ben-Gurion’s constant themes. In internal discussion in 1938, he stated that **“after we become a strong force, as the result of the creation of a state, we shall abolish partition and expand to the whole of Palestine. The state will only be a stage in the realization of Zionism and its task is to prepare the ground for our expansion into the whole of Palestine by a Jewish-Arab agreement. The state will have to preserve order not only by preaching morality but by machine guns, if necessary.”**\n\nThe “agreement” that Ben-Gurion had in mind was to be with King Abdullah of Jordan, who would be induced to cede areas of cis-Jordan under his control, while many of the Arab residents would leave. Earlier, **Ben-Gurion had explained to Arab interlocutors that “our land” included Transjordan, and that it extended from the Sinai to “the source of the Jordan.”** In internal discussion he urged that “we do not suggest now to announce the final aim,” which is “far-reaching,” even more so than the aim of those who were opposing partition. “I am unwilling to abandon the great Jewish vision, the final vision,” he added. This vision, here unspecified in scale, “is an organic, spiritual and ideological component of my Jewishness and my Zionist aspiration,” Ben-Gurion explained.\"  \n([https://archive.org/details/NoamChomskyFatefulTriangleF/page/n287/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/NoamChomskyFatefulTriangleF/page/n287/mode/2up))\n\n...\n\n\"Although the Jewish Agency accepted the partition plan, it did not accept the proposed borders as final and Israel's declaration of independence avoided the mention of any boundaries. A state in part of Palestine was seen as a stage towards a larger state when opportunity allowed. Although the borders were “bad from a military and political point of view,” **Ben Gurion urged fellow Jews to accept the UN Partition Plan, pointing out that arrangements are never final, “not with regard to the regime, not with regard to borders, and not with regard to international agreements.”**\n\nThe idea of partition being a temporary expedient dated back to the Peel Partition proposal of 1937. When the Zionist Congress had rejected partition on the grounds that the Jews had an inalienable right to settle anywhere in Palestine, **Ben Gurion had argued in favour of acceptance: “I see in the realisation of this plan practically the decisive stage in the beginning of full redemption and the most wonderful lever for the gradual conquest of all of Palestine.”**  \n([https://archive.org/details/palestineisraelu0000mcdo/mode/2up?q=full+redemption](https://archive.org/details/palestineisraelu0000mcdo/mode/2up?q=full+redemption))\n\n“After the formation of a large army in the wake of the establishment of the state, we will abolish partition and expand to the whole of Palestine.”  \n— Ben Gurion, p. 22, *The Birth of Israel* (1987), Simha Flapan.\n\n“If it was permissible to move an Arab from the Galilee to Judea, why it is impossible to move an Arab from Hebron to Transjordan, which is much closer? There are vast expanses of land there and we are overcrowded. Even the High Commission agrees to a transfer to Transjordan if we equip the peasants with land and money. If the Peel Commission and the London Government accept, we’ll remove the land problem from the agenda.”",

This constitutes the basis for a genuine understanding between us and the Arabs.” \nBen-Gurion at Labor Conference, quoted in Mendes-Flohr, *A Land of Two Peoples: Martin Buber on Jews and Arabs*, University of Chicago Press, 1983, p. 6.\n\nWalter Laqueur writes in *A History of Zionism* (1972) that the idea of population transfer was never Zionist policy and “Ben-Gurion emphatically rejected it, saying that even if Jews were given the right to evict Arabs they would not make use of it” (p. 232). Laqueur has more along these lines on Ben-Gurion and other Zionist leaders in this same chapter I can add to later, as well as other authors. \n\nEdit: See also Anita Shapira on Ben-Gurion’s crucial decision regarding the West Bank in 1948 war (*Ben Gurion: Father of Modern Israel*, Yale University Press, 1971, p. 173). I believe Benny Morris covers that decision in *1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War* (2008) as well on p. 386 (“urging Ben-Gurion to order the conquest of the West Bank”).",

He also says later in his testimony:\n\nThis is a very misleading reading of Ben Gurion's testimony. Yes, he was not in favor of a bi-national state. But that doesn't mean partition was his favored solution. What he wanted was to establish some sort of trusteeship over the territory, which would allow for large scale Jewish immigration, before establishing a Jewish state in the entirety of Palestine. This was necessary because a democracy could not be established without a Jewish majority.\n\n&gt;CHAIRMAN: On the other hand, we see that you want the abolition of the Mandate and you do not want the substitution of a trusteeship, or something of that kind, for the Mandate. Then the question must come up: how do you think that immigration could be implemented if the Mandate has ceased? What kind of government do you think should be established in this country instead of the Mandate?\n\n&gt;Mr. BEN GURION: Well, that is a very legitimate question, and a very sensible question, and I will try to answer you to the best of my ability. We say that the White Paper policy is illegal, and therefore, it should be removed at once. The Mandate, in fact, does not exist because it was violated by the Mandatory. We are not in favour of renewing it. We do not believe that in the future it will be carried out better than in the past. Therefore, we say that the original intention and the need, and what in our conviction is just, should be decided upon by the United Nations, and a Jewish State should be established.\n\n&gt;There are two parts in the establishment of a state: one is the material part, which is the most essential; the other is the legal part, the purely formal one, which is also of great importance.\n\n&gt;I will say a word about the material establishment, because the whole difficulty of the problem here is that you have a people, you have a country, and their right to the country was acknowledged, but the people do not happen to be there yet. They were dispossessed, and they have to come back. So, the first thing is the material establishment of the state, which means that plans based on our experience and on achievements, examined and approved by experts-economic, irrigation, agricultural, industrial experts, and so on-should be examined by the Committee and the United Nations to see how they can be carried out; and that a million Jews should be resettled in their country.\n\n&gt;In our view it is not only possible, but it is possible to do so by good will. It is possible to do it in a very short time. This is the material establishment of a national home for the Jewish State. This may take some time. In the meantime, it will be supervised by the highest authority of the United Nations. The fact that the Mandatory itself referred it to the United Nations implies a certain recognition that this is the place where it has to be judged and de, decided, although the Mandatory did not undertake formally to carry it out. But there is an indication that this is the place where it should be decided.\n\n&gt;Assuming that on the recommendations of your Committee the United Nations approves of that plan, the material establishment, it means the settlement of the first million Jews I say a million, it may be 900,000 or it may be 1,100,000, to state a round figure-in the shortest possible time. Even the shortest possible time may and must take some time. I am unable to say how long it will take. I think no one is able to say that, because there are always in human affairs unforeseen things which may happen. But it should not take longer, as far as w.e can judge now-it must not take longer than a few years. Not necessarily longer than a few years. Then, in the meantime, a committee, or any instrument which the United Nations will decide on, will supervise.\n\nQuotes continued in comment below",

The question does not arise on the Mandate. But my answer to the question is, you have to decide whether what we ask is right or wrong. If it is right, and force is necessary, you have to apply it. If it is wrong, not only you do not have to apply force, but you do not have to allow it. It is a question of right and wrong, and not whether to apply or not to apply force, as in any other conflict in the world.

Or they could be like the Deep South USA classes that say 100% abstinence is the only way to be safe and pure and girls can use the birth control of keeping a penny between her knees. Condoms are actually a good one because many people are actually not aware of how to properly store condoms, how to properly apply, how to tell if the condom breaks and what to do if it does. But condoms, if used perfectly, has a 98% success rate for pregnancy and an effective rate of 85-87% because of the above issues. That means that out of 100 people all using condoms you can expect every year 15-17 of them will have a baby. Actually it’s probably higher as it obviously can count how many women got pregnant but it does as a zygote or morula or blastocyst and such. The numbers would be lower if the Pill was also used then it would be lower. However, I don’t know how much access they have to the Pill or condoms. I can’t imagine the refugee camps are full of condoms when they are focusing on food.",

It's true, they're still pumping 'em out far above the international average, but we must remember that this average is falling both the world over and of course within Palestinian society within and outside the territories. For Palestinians within Israel and the territories the fertility rate used to be around 9, which was an \\*eye-watering\\* number. The immediate diaspora was probably similar, given their rate of growth. Still, it's down to either half that or in some cases approaching a more a \"western\" rate, depending on where you look and who you look at. \n\nNow, we don't really have the data necessary to make an accurate assessment of how the present stage of the conflict will affect fertility rates either now (reported births are reportedly down 41%, but \"recorded births\" is the operative phrase here) or within the next few years. However, we can make some ballpark speculation and assume it'll probably go up. Access to healthcare was a \\*big\\* reason for the global drop in fertility over the 20th century, since it upended one of the main reasons for pumping out kids, which was general childhood mortality. Well, the healthcare system is in ruins and will probably remain so for at least a few years. And the natural human response to increased childhood mortality, as we've seen the world over, is really just \"keep on pumpin' \". Y'know, roll the dice, if you make more well then at least a couple of em might make it to adulthood. That'll probably lead to a brief explosion in fertility if healthcare is rebuilt rapidly, as was the case with the 20th century expansion of healthcare infrastructure, which should of course occur for moral reasons but even so one must acknowledge what can also occur alongside.",

In it, she asked her followers for recommendations for bagels in New York, specifying, “I don’t want to be giving any of my money to genocidal maniacs,” and adding that she was looking for shops that are either “actively pro-Palestinian” or “known to not be in support of that hell-hole place and Zionism” – clearly seeking to avoid Jewish-owned stores.\"\n\n\"On October 17, 2023, in response to an explosion outside the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, Save the Children’s Country Director for the West Bank and Gaza Jason Lee said stated, “Our worst fears are being realized. We’re seeing schools and hospitals – places of safety and sanctuary – being targeted. Civilian infrastructure like hospitals and schools must be protected at all times.” Lee ignored the videos, images, and intelligence materials demonstrating that an Islamic Jihad rocket had “misfired” (i.e. detonated in Gaza instead of Israel) and hit the hospital parking lot.\"\n\n\"In October 2020, Save the Children published a report on “the impact of the Israeli military detention system on Palestinian children.” Save the Children itself acknowledged that the data presented in the publication “is not a statistically significant or representative sample. As the report intentionally presents children’s experience from their own perspective, it is also important to note that incidents they mention have not been independently verified by Save the Children”. The report severely downplays the extent and severity of violence committed by Palestinian minors against Israeli civilians and soldiers, and ignores the widespread phenomena of incitement prevalent in the West Bank.\"\n\n\n\"In November 2018, during the violence on the Gaza border, Save the Children stated that “The Israeli government must end the use of sniper fire and live ammunition against children in Gaza. The killing and wounding of children is never acceptable.” Save the Children does not question why these children were present in an obviously violent situation where there was a known potential for injury, nor does the organization condemn Hamas and other Palestinian terror groups’ recruitment and use of children throughout the violence. The NGO also ignored the violent nature of the protests, which have consisted of an organized armed attack on the Israeli border and IDF positions, attempts to destroy and breach the border fence, and sustained arson, rocket, and mortar attacks on Israeli civilian communities.\"\n\n\n\"On May 18, 2018, Save the Children and the Palestinian Center for Democracy and Conflict Resolution sponsored a workshop at the Dar al Huda kindergarten, “Training of Teachers on Positive Discipline in Everyday Teaching.”\nOn May 26, 2018, the Dar al Huda kindergarten in Gaza held a graduation ceremony that included the mock killing and kidnapping of Israelis by children dressed as combatants.1 The simulation included sophisticated equipment such as drones, body cameras, military fatigues, body armor, and sniper camouflage. Children wore headbands representing Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), designated as a terrorist organization by the US, EU, and others.\"\n\n\n\"During the 2014 Gaza conflict, Save the Children published a full-page advertisement in papers throughout the UK of the names of Palestinian children who were killed; a similar list of Israeli children was not produced.\"\n\n\n\"Save the Children has repeatedly joined in the demonization campaign falsely accusing Israel of employing starvation as a method of warfare against Hamas. These allegations have been repeatedly shown to be based on fundamental methodological errors and overwhelmingly disproven by publicly available information.\"",

This tactic is also referred to as Palestinian suicide terrorism. It emerged in the 1990s and reached its peak during the Second Intifada (2000–2005). Attacks occurred at various locations, including shopping centers, public buses, transit stations, cafes, nightclubs, and restaurants, According to a 2006 study from the University of Haifa, only a few of the bombings targeted military objectives. Between 1994 and 2005, suicide bombings killed 735 Israelis and wounded 4,554.\"\n\n\nFrom Yasser Arafat himself:\n\n“All of us are willing to be martyrs… until our flag flies over Jerusalem…” — In a speech to Palestinian workers in Gaza in January 1995, Arafat spoke of being willing to die in the struggle and tied that to “martyrdom.”\n\n“The commitment still stands… via deaths, via sacrifices.” — At Al-Azhar University in Gaza in June 1995, he invoked jihad and sacrifice in the fight against Israel, a phrase critics argue was used to legitimize violence.\n\n“We ask Allah to grant us martyrdom… To Jerusalem we march, martyrs by the millions.”\n\n“We ask Allah to grant us martyrdom… To Jerusalem we march, martyrs by the millions.”\n\nhttps://palwatch.org/page/297\n\nYasser Arafat, in a speech to children:\n\n     \"We are saluting the spirit of our hero Shahid, Faris Ouda! Faris Ouda! Faris Ouda! We are proud of you [youth] who represent the steadfastness and the sacrifice of your companion, the hero Shahid, Faris Ouda! Oh, children of Palestine!

You can't break that. The Persians (Iranians) have thousands, and I mean it, of years of being there and a nation mentality the Arabs (AKA Palestinians) don't have. It is a made up group with a jihad mentality, hence their inability to build anything but... well, war, terrorism, death. It is sad a but a fact nonetheless.",

If by \"the situation in Iran\" one means the fall of the Mullah's, unfortunately that seems less and less in the cards at present.\n\n\\*However\\*, it does seem like Iran is going to stay in prolonged economic crisis for a while that will limit its ability to fund groups like Hamas, since of course between allocating money for this sort of thing and allocating it for IRGC paycheques it's sort of an obvious choice. It loses the latter well then now the regime \\*could\\* fall. So, all in all a diminished Hamas can sort of be expected, unless someone decides to now announce to foot the bills.\n\nAs for what changes, well that's difficult to say, since really it's a matter of how things shake out with the interim administration. Apparently, the head of the proposed interim admin has went and said he'd rebuild the place in 7 years and make new Gazan land by just pushing all the rubble into the sea (with bulldozers he doesn't have), \\*very\\* bold claims for a former deputy minister of of Transportation. It's important to note that Hamas used to operate with much less of a budget, but thrived because of the failures of the government it contended against. If the interim admin fares the same, well then people start saying \"man I miss Hamas\" then it's kinda back to square one, albeit in a much-diminished form. You know, no more fancy smuggled rockets and back to just jumped up RPG rounds on a metal tube, if those are even in the budget.",

There's a funny episode around the winding down the second intifada where PA forces in Gaza were raiding a lot of these charities diverting funds to Hamas with gusto, but it was backfiring hard (they were still at the end of the day charities doing charitable stuff) and then the solution that was decided was \"do nothing\".\n\nA thing with this is it was \"relatively\" well known before the present stage of the conflict, leaders up to Haniyeh himself would give interviews saying \"yes, we get Iranian money\" on the reg and articles reporting Hamas getting more Iran money would be published without much controversy.",

When in reality there wasn’t even a mass exodus or forced deportations, the Jewish diaspora is much older than the Roman occupation of Palestine and was mostly driven by voluntary expansion around the Mediterranean for trade opportunities.\n\nThey also believe the Nakba was 750k people just voluntarily leaving. They obviously leave off all the well documented massacres, the well poisonings in Operation Cast Thy Bread, Plan Dalet, bombing villages in the middle of the night, etc.\n\nThey believe a lot of weird stuff too from the Bible. Like even secular atheist Israelis believe certain stories are literally factually true history and should influence modern politics. Even when almost every scholar and archeologist and expert agrees the stories are myth. For example Joshua and the wall of Jericho. Or the Exodus story.\n\nAll this to say, don’t take history lessons from a Zionist.",

Gaza is almost pacified so give it another year maybe and they'll be completely disarmed. Send in the wheel excavators and they could have the ground scrubbed of unexploded munitions and tunnels in less than another year. Start with a nice flat clean slate and some nice new tents, eliminate the antagonists like the UN and hamas and Gaza, in a generation or so might be ready for an easing of restrictions, who knows, I guess it depends on them if they want to live in peace or not. \n\nGiving up the settlements isn't going to happen, again nothing in it for Israel. Asking Israel to pay reparations is nuts, they didn't start it, speaking of which, the Israeli's are still owed reparations from when they were thrown out of all those Arab nations, and particularly in the West Bank by Jordan and in the Old Trans-Jordon. In the end reparations work out more in favor of Israel than the Arabs in the mandate area. Again, nothing in it for Israel. \n\nMy two cents is that plan would never work. I think a better plan would be for Gaza to voluntarily disarm immediately and peacefully evacuate all areas behind the yellow line as penance for the atrocities of 10/7. Surrender all hamas members to the Israeli army within 30 days or face consequences. \n\nThe West Bank is a whole other can of worms. \n\nAnyway its great that folks are trying to come up with solutions but its got to be equitable and it must take into consideration that Israel has been forced to defend itself from day one and has no reason to lift restrictions. Trust is something you gain over time and so far its been one terrorist act after another so, Israel has no incentive to lift restrictions. \n\nMy two cents   \nCheers.",

So might as well deal with it all at once and dig up the tunnels while your at it.  \nHere's my plan\n\nI'm sure the plan could be improved but the nuts and bolts are there.\n\nIsrael should take the coastline in Gaza, its a huge smuggling risk and if the Gazan's aren't going to willingly disarm then its a must. Say a one mile buffer zone between the water and the Arabs. Two would be better. Extend the Yellow line to the Wadi Gaza and take the coast along the entire strip. That'd pin hamas in a manageable area with no chance of importing any more weapons.\n\nThe order of operations should be something like.\n\n1. Evacuate all civilians south of the Wadi Gaza but within the current yellow line to the north.\n2. Wheel excavators sift and flatten the area within the yellow line south of the Wadi Gaza down to a depth of about 50 meters.\n3. evacuate all civilians north of the Wadi Gaza back to the south and within the existing yellow line except for a new buffer zone along the coast one mile deep.\n4. The new yellow line is moved forward to the Wadi Gaza taking an additional 25% or so of Gaza in reparations for failing to disarm and the atrocities of 10/7.\n5. wheel excavators flatten the area north of the Wadi Gaza.\n6. wheel excavators move on to flatten the remaining areas controlled by Israel behind the yellow line.\n\nResult.  \n7) All of Gaza is now cleared of unexploded munitions and buildings intact or otherwise, all rubble has been removed for recycling and use outside of Gaza. No salvageable building materials should be left within Gaza. Gaza is flat as a pancake ready to rebuild when conditions are met.  \n8) Hamas is now contained in an area of about 30 square miles of flat gravel sifted of any and all building materials and tunnels down to a depth of about 50 meters.  \n9) set up a 28 square mile refugee tent city and a 2 square mile POW camp.  \n10) Review and register all as they come to the aid stations within the new camp and place them accordingly.  \n11) Aid stations and resources should be controlled and operated by the IDF and all recipients certified as legit refugees.  \n12) The cost of clearing Gaza and operating the refugee camp should come out of the Gaza reconstruction fund or UN funds with the IDF being compensated for its participation. No NGOs should be allowed to participate.  \n13) POW camps should be run and funded in accordance with the Geneva Conventions  \n14) No reconstruction should begin until a period of ten years has passed without incident.\n\nIn the end you've created a legit refugee camp devoid of combatants and antagonistic influences and segregated the belligerents in the accordance with the Geneva conventions. Let the peace process begin. In a decade or so, reconstruction could begin as long as the refugees remain peaceful and build some trust with their Israeli neighbors first. \n\nThe problem thus far is that the UN refused to segregate combatants from non combatants and instead, actively supported their employ within the UN, thus subverting the entire goal of peace between the two parties.\n\nIsrael will need to start over with a clean slate in order to re educate the civilian population while incarcerating the radicals in the POW camp. POWs will need to remain incarcerated until deportations arrangements can be made.\n\nEmigration by the refugees should be immediately allowed to anywhere outside of the mandate area.\n\nThe solution is simple, confine the problem to a smaller and smaller areas and limit the risks through proper preparation of the site, which in this case means flattening all of Gaza. Those huge wheel excavators could handle it in no time. Less than a year depending on how many you have. I'd. say a half dozen of the Bagger wheel excavators would do the job in less than a year.\n\nCheers",

Even Egypt is terrified of the Gazans, and other Arab states are also less-than-enamored of them. I don't think Israel's population would ever accept a population inflow like that.

In other words, what you're describing is an agreement by which Gazans can potentially live in Israel (and thereby attempt to reclaim their lost property there), while the West Bank population would not have a similar right. Given the divide between Gaza and the West Bank politically, I doubt the former would agree to this. I may be wrong though -- who knows? \n\nYou're trying to achieve a balance of taking-and-giving to make things fair--however, for both sides, most of what you're describing crosses important \"red lines\" that are unacceptable to each party. This, of course, is why the conflict persists. There's no real middle ground in this conflict. The Israelis don't want to give up land. The Palestinians won't give up their land claims or their \"right of return.\" \n\nAlso -- I'm not Jewish or Israeli -- but I know for a fact the Israelis will never accept a return to a divided Jerusalem.

And Israeli citizenship is not a booby prize for losing a war with Israel. I do not want former Hamas or PIJ personnel and their families moving into Tel Aviv, or Haifa, or Qiryat Shmoneh.\n\nFurthermore, 80% of West bank settlers live close to the Green line in settlement blocs that can easily be exchanged with Israel. There is no need to relocate all of them. That's an unreasonable ask.\n\nWhat is more, besides E Jerusalem, all of the West Bank remains unannexed. So your distinction between \"unannexed\" and \"annexed\" doesn't make sense.\n\nAdditionally, the Israeli concern with Palestinian statehood now in the West Bank is that such a state without Israeli military presence may be used as a launch pad for attacks against Israel, like South Lebanon and Gaza were used. However, the West Bank is on Jerusalem's municipal border and just a few km from Tel Aviv and Ben Gurion airport, on higher ground. This plan does not address this security risk at all. There are no security guarantees. You demand that Palestine \"demilitarize\", but without the IDF there to ensure that, who is there to enforce it.\n\nNor are there any institutional demands on the Palestinians for statehood. The Palestinian national movement for a century has spent very little of its effort developing effective institutions for statehood. There are no requirements for Palestinians to develop effective state institutions. The current PA is weak and ineffective, and institutions are weak. Without strong state institutions, the Palestinian state is likely to devolve into conflict, which will inevitably used as an excuse to attack Israel, unless this piece is taken seriously.\n\nFinally, there is no demand of Palestinians to give up ideology of opposition to Israel and annihilation of the Jewish state. So long as that is the national ideology of Palestine, the result will be the same. This ideology is not \"radical\" in Palestinian society, but mainstream. Without a plan to deradicalize and actually have Palestinian society accept that Jews are not foreigners and Israel but belong there, and have a right to self determination, then we haven't moved an inch.",

However, as things in the world evolved throughout the 20th century, he changed. \n\nCalling either Einstein or Ben Gurion “Bernie sanders” is probably not fair. Why? Because it can be abused for political purposes. Bernie sanders is a 21st century American politician. Ben Gurion and Einstein are 19th century early 20th century figures. Saying they were “essentially Bernie sanders” is probably going to be used as propaganda to get support for Bernie sanders. It’s using dead people who aren’t alive right now to say what they think to help the political interest of rich American politicians. So unless it’s a very specific statement with a very narrow meaning in a very specific context, this statement is propaganda",

Einstein’s connection with Judaism was tinged by this very distinction, the one we try to draw today! He loved his people and their customs and traditions, and wanted to secure their safety. But he was also painfully aware of what the homogeneity (a bit reductive, but just for instance) of a society can be used for in the wrong hands (fascism).",

His views changed in the letter to Nehru as you quoted.\n\nHe said in a 1938 speech:\n\n&gt; I should much rather see reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of living together in peace than the creation of a Jewish state. My awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists the idea of a Jewish state with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power, no matter how modest. I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustain—especially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our own ranks, against which we have already had to fight strongly, even without a Jewish state. ... If external necessity should after all compel us to assume this burden, let us bear it with tact and patience.\n\nAfter independence, he supported Israel but was critical of the violence that was inflicted to achieve it. (That's a sensible take).\n\n---\n\nEinstein's discourse on Zionism is as a means to right the wrongs done to Jews in Europe and to demand their own homeland as others had. I think it notably lacks mention of the injustices that were to be done and later done to the Palestinians. That's important because those injustices, known globally in retrospect, are the core of the Palestinian issue.\n\nHis statements are not egregious or unexpected. He was neither a decision-maker in the World Zionist Congress / Jewish Agency in Palestine, nor on the ground in Palestine to see the events unfold. He just wanted justice for his people.",

However, they have never stated to conquer the entire Middle East, or Palestine.\n\nThere are many issues with your post but this conclusion you came to is just flat out false, since you brought up Ben Gurion for instance:\n\n\"Does the establishment of a Jewish state \\[in only part of Palestine\\] advance or retard the conversion of this country into a Jewish country? My assumption (which is why I am a fervent proponent of a state, even though it is now linked to partition) is that a Jewish state on only part of the land is not the end but the beginning. This is because this increase in possession is of consequence not only in itself, but because through it we increase our strength, and **every increase in strength helps in the possession of the land as a whole.** The establishment of a state, even if only on a portion of the land, is the maximal reinforcement of our strength at the present time and a powerful boost to our historical endeavors to liberate the entire country.\" \\[9\\]  \n([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937\\_Ben-Gurion\\_letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937_Ben-Gurion_letter))\n\nYou go over a portion of this letter in your post so it's strange you didn't actually examine it in its totality, as you were complaining about others not doing.\n\n...\n\n\"Weizmann and Ben-Gurion pressed for a solution based on partition. Said Weizmann: 'The Jews would be fools not to accept it, even if \\[the land they were allocated\\] were the size of a table cloth.' Both saw partition as a stepping stone to further expansion and the eventual takeover of the whole of Palestine. **'No Zionist can forgo the smallest portion of the Land of Israel,'** Ben-Gurion was quoted as saying.\"  \n([https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr\\_0/page/138/mode/2up?q=stepping+stone](https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr_0/page/138/mode/2up?q=stepping+stone))\n\n...\n\n\"It might be noted that the “boundaries of Zionist aspirations” in Ben Gurion’s “vision” were quite broad, including southern Lebanon, southern Syria, today’s Jordan, all of cis-Jordan, and the Sinai. This was, in fact, one of Ben-Gurion’s constant themes. In internal discussion in 1938, he stated that **“after we become a strong force, as the result of the creation of a state, we shall abolish partition and expand to the whole of Palestine. The state will only be a stage in the realization of Zionism and its task is to prepare the ground for our expansion into the whole of Palestine by a Jewish-Arab agreement. The state will have to preserve order not only by preaching morality but by machine guns, if necessary.”**\n\nThe “agreement” that Ben-Gurion had in mind was to be with King Abdullah of Jordan, who would be induced to cede areas of cis-Jordan under his control, while many of the Arab residents would leave. Earlier, **Ben-Gurion had explained to Arab interlocutors that “our land” included Transjordan, and that it extended from the Sinai to “the source of the Jordan.”** In internal discussion he urged that “we do not suggest now to announce the final aim,” which is “far-reaching,” even more so than the aim of those who were opposing partition. “I am unwilling to abandon the great Jewish vision, the final vision,” he added. This vision, here unspecified in scale, “is an organic, spiritual and ideological component of my Jewishness and my Zionist aspiration,” Ben-Gurion explained.\"  \n([https://archive.org/details/NoamChomskyFatefulTriangleF/page/n287/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/NoamChomskyFatefulTriangleF/page/n287/mode/2up))\n\n...\n\n\"Although the Jewish Agency accepted the partition plan, it did not accept the proposed borders as final and Israel's declaration of independence avoided the mention of any boundaries. A state in part of Palestine was seen as a stage towards a larger state when opportunity allowed. Although the borders were “bad from a military and political point of view,” **Ben Gurion urged fellow Jews to accept the UN Partition Plan, pointing out that arrangements are never final, “not with regard to the regime, not with regard to borders, and not with regard to international agreements.”**\n\nThe idea of partition being a temporary expedient dated back to the Peel Partition proposal of 1937. When the Zionist Congress had rejected partition on the grounds that the Jews had an inalienable right to settle anywhere in Palestine, **Ben Gurion had argued in favour of acceptance: “I see in the realisation of this plan practically the decisive stage in the beginning of full redemption and the most wonderful lever for the gradual conquest of all of Palestine.”**  \n([https://archive.org/details/palestineisraelu0000mcdo/mode/2up?q=full+redemption](https://archive.org/details/palestineisraelu0000mcdo/mode/2up?q=full+redemption))\n\n“After the formation of a large army in the wake of the establishment of the state, we will abolish partition and expand to the whole of Palestine.”  \n— Ben Gurion, p. 22, *The Birth of Israel* (1987), Simha Flapan.\n\n“If it was permissible to move an Arab from the Galilee to Judea, why it is impossible to move an Arab from Hebron to Transjordan, which is much closer? There are vast expanses of land there and we are overcrowded. Even the High Commission agrees to a transfer to Transjordan if we equip the peasants with land and money. If the Peel Commission and the London Government accept, we’ll remove the land problem from the agenda.”",

We must accept this fact with love and draw all the necessary conclusions from it. This constitutes the basis for a genuine understanding between us and the Arabs.” \nBen-Gurion at Labor Conference, quoted in Mendes-Flohr, *A Land of Two Peoples: Martin Buber on Jews and Arabs*, University of Chicago Press, 1983, p. 6.\n\nWalter Laqueur writes in *A History of Zionism* (1972) that the idea of population transfer was never Zionist policy and “Ben-Gurion emphatically rejected it, saying that even if Jews were given the right to evict Arabs they would not make use of it” (p. 232). Laqueur has more along these lines on Ben-Gurion and other Zionist leaders in this same chapter I can add to later, as well as other authors. \n\nEdit: See also Anita Shapira on Ben-Gurion’s crucial decision regarding the West Bank in 1948 war (*Ben Gurion: Father of Modern Israel*, Yale University Press, 1971, p. 173). I believe Benny Morris covers that decision in *1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War* (2008) as well on p. 386 (“urging Ben-Gurion to order the conquest of the West Bank”).",

I am simply showing statements from Ben Gurion where he does, in fact, advocate expanding to the entirety of Palestine.\n\nNot only does the quote you posted merely state that he did not want to displace the Arab population (something else), but we can also acknowledge that Ben Gurion’s views evolved over time,  In the 1920s, for example, he at one point proposed a canton system. Eventually he realized that they ought to be resettled in Transjordan.\n\nIn any case, OP's claim that Zionist leaders or Ben Gurion specifically, did not want to conquer the entirety of Palestine is wrong . His own statements explicitly frame partition as a temporary stage and expansion over all of Palestine as a long term objective, even if his views on population transfer changed over time.",

    "body": "&gt;Ben Gurion: \"We want to have a State of our own, and that State can be federate if the other State or States is or are willing to do so in the mutual interest, on condition that our State is in its own right a Member of the United Nations.\"\n\n&gt;Note that he accepts another state in this discussion, indicating favor towards partition and possible federation (i.e. the economic union proposed in UNSCOP). He also says later in his testimony:\n\nThis is a very misleading reading of Ben Gurion's testimony. Yes, he was not in favor of a bi-national state. But that doesn't mean partition was his favored solution. What he wanted was to establish some sort of trusteeship over the territory, which would allow for large scale Jewish immigration, before establishing a Jewish state in the entirety of Palestine. This was necessary because a democracy could not be established without a Jewish majority.\n\n&gt;CHAIRMAN: On the other hand, we see that you want the abolition of the Mandate and you do not want the substitution of a trusteeship, or something of that kind, for the Mandate. Then the question must come up: how do you think that immigration could be implemented if the Mandate has ceased? What kind of government do you think should be established in this country instead of the Mandate?\n\n&gt;Mr. BEN GURION: Well, that is a very legitimate question, and a very sensible question, and I will try to answer you to the best of my ability. We say that the White Paper policy is illegal, and therefore, it should be removed at once. The Mandate, in fact, does not exist because it was violated by the Mandatory. We are not in favour of renewing it. We do not believe that in the future it will be carried out better than in the past. Therefore, we say that the original intention and the need, and what in our conviction is just, should be decided upon by the United Nations, and a Jewish State should be established.\n\n&gt;There are two parts in the establishment of a state: one is the material part, which is the most essential; the other is the legal part, the purely formal one, which is also of great importance.\n\n&gt;I will say a word about the material establishment, because the whole difficulty of the problem here is that you have a people, you have a country, and their right to the country was acknowledged, but the people do not happen to be there yet. They were dispossessed, and they have to come back. So, the first thing is the material establishment of the state, which means that plans based on our experience and on achievements, examined and approved by experts-economic, irrigation, agricultural, industrial experts, and so on-should be examined by the Committee and the United Nations to see how they can be carried out; and that a million Jews should be resettled in their country.\n\n&gt;In our view it is not only possible, but it is possible to do so by good will. It is possible to do it in a very short time. This is the material establishment of a national home for the Jewish State. This may take some time. In the meantime, it will be supervised by the highest authority of the United Nations. The fact that the Mandatory itself referred it to the United Nations implies a certain recognition that this is the place where it has to be judged and de, decided, although the Mandatory did not undertake formally to carry it out. But there is an indication that this is the place where it should be decided.\n\n&gt;Assuming that on the recommendations of your Committee the United Nations approves of that plan, the material establishment, it means the settlement of the first million Jews I say a million, it may be 900,000 or it may be 1,100,000, to state a round figure-in the shortest possible time. Even the shortest possible time may and must take some time. I am unable to say how long it will take. I think no one is able to say that, because there are always in human affairs unforeseen things which may happen. But it should not take longer, as far as w.e can judge now-it must not take longer than a few years. Not necessarily longer than a few years. Then, in the meantime, a committee, or any instrument which the United Nations will decide on, will supervise.\n\nQuotes continued in comment below",

When the United Nations will see that the main purpose for which, this country is destined, to solve the Jewish problem, that the main thing has been done and that the time is ripe to undertake administration of the Government itself, then the second phase, the legal, the formal establishment of a state will be reached. **Whether it will take two years or three years, I cannot say, but in that transition period it will be in charge of the United Nations. That is all we envisage here.**  \n  \n  \nCHAIRMAN: Let us assume that there would be violent resistance to enforcing the immigration, would you mean, in any circumstances, to go on and fight down the resistance?\n\n&gt;Mr. BEN GURION: I said we do not ask for a Mandate any more, so it is not a question. The question does not arise on the Mandate. But my answer to the question is, you have to decide whether what we ask is right or wrong. If it is right, and force is necessary, you have to apply it. If it is wrong, not only you do not have to apply force, but you do not have to allow it. It is a question of right and wrong, and not whether to apply or not to apply force, as in any other conflict in the world. And this is the reason the United Nations was established.\n\n&gt;Mr. RAND   (Canada):  I suppose that is one case in which you can resort to absolutes.\n\n&gt;Mr. BEN GURION: No absolutes. This was the reason why we were ready in 1937 I mean the majority-to consider a compromise. **Although we knew we were entitled to an entire country, when the British Government came and told us the result of that Commission, they said, you are right, but this will require force and we do not want it and we cannot do it, and therefore we tell you here is a compromise. The majority said, that they were willing to consider it.**  \n\n\n  \n...  \n\n\n&gt;  \nCHAIRMAN: I think, Mr. GARCIA GRANDOS, that you overlooked one factor in Mr. BEN GURION's previous answer. **This transition period was aimed at creating a Jewish majority, and that is the reason for the supervision.**\n\n&gt;Mr. GARCIA GRANDOS (Guatemala): **That is why I would like to ask you whether it refers to the whole of Palestine or to part of Palestine the transition period, I mean.**\n\n&gt;Mr. BEN GURION: **I said that in a part of Palestine we do not need any transitional period. If it is the whole of Palestine, we may need a short transitional period.**\n\n[https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-178863/](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-178863/)",

Condoms are actually a good one because many people are actually not aware of how to properly store condoms, how to properly apply, how to tell if the condom breaks and what to do if it does. But condoms, if used perfectly, has a 98% success rate for pregnancy and an effective rate of 85-87% because of the above issues. That means that out of 100 people all using condoms you can expect every year 15-17 of them will have a baby. Actually it’s probably higher as it obviously can count how many women got pregnant but it does as a zygote or morula or blastocyst and such. The numbers would be lower if the Pill was also used then it would be lower. However, I don’t know how much access they have to the Pill or condoms.

It's true, they're still pumping 'em out far above the international average, but we must remember that this average is falling both the world over and of course within Palestinian society within and outside the territories. For Palestinians within Israel and the territories the fertility rate used to be around 9, which was an \\*eye-watering\\* number. The immediate diaspora was probably similar, given their rate of growth. Still, it's down to either half that or in some cases approaching a more a \"western\" rate, depending on where you look and who you look at. \n\nNow, we don't really have the data necessary to make an accurate assessment of how the present stage of the conflict will affect fertility rates either now (reported births are reportedly down 41%, but \"recorded births\" is the operative phrase here) or within the next few years. However, we can make some ballpark speculation and assume it'll probably go up. Access to healthcare was a \\*big\\* reason for the global drop in fertility over the 20th century, since it upended one of the main reasons for pumping out kids, which was general childhood mortality. Well, the healthcare system is in ruins and will probably remain so for at least a few years. And the natural human response to increased childhood mortality, as we've seen the world over, is really just \"keep on pumpin' \". Y'know, roll the dice, if you make more well then at least a couple of em might make it to adulthood. That'll probably lead to a brief explosion in fertility if healthcare is rebuilt rapidly, as was the case with the 20th century expansion of healthcare infrastructure, which should of course occur for moral reasons but even so one must acknowledge what can also occur alongside.",

    "body": "&gt; Save the Children reported more children had died in three weeks in Gaza than in the entire sum of conflicts around the world in the past four years.\n\n\"In January 2025, Yasmin Ghaffar, a member of Save the Children UK’s public affairs team, posted a blatantly antisemitic TikTok video. In it, she asked her followers for recommendations for bagels in New York, specifying, “I don’t want to be giving any of my money to genocidal maniacs,” and adding that she was looking for shops that are either “actively pro-Palestinian” or “known to not be in support of that hell-hole place and Zionism” – clearly seeking to avoid Jewish-owned stores.\"\n\n\"On October 17, 2023, in response to an explosion outside the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, Save the Children’s Country Director for the West Bank and Gaza Jason Lee said stated, “Our worst fears are being realized. We’re seeing schools and hospitals – places of safety and sanctuary – being targeted. Civilian infrastructure like hospitals and schools must be protected at all times.” Lee ignored the videos, images, and intelligence materials demonstrating that an Islamic Jihad rocket had “misfired” (i.e. detonated in Gaza instead of Israel) and hit the hospital parking lot.\"\n\n\"In October 2020, Save the Children published a report on “the impact of the Israeli military detention system on Palestinian children.” Save the Children itself acknowledged that the data presented in the publication “is not a statistically significant or representative sample. As the report intentionally presents children’s experience from their own perspective, it is also important to note that incidents they mention have not been independently verified by Save the Children”. The report severely downplays the extent and severity of violence committed by Palestinian minors against Israeli civilians and soldiers, and ignores the widespread phenomena of incitement prevalent in the West Bank.\"\n\n\n\"In November 2018, during the violence on the Gaza border, Save the Children stated that “The Israeli government must end the use of sniper fire and live ammunition against children in Gaza. The killing and wounding of children is never acceptable.” Save the Children does not question why these children were present in an obviously violent situation where there was a known potential for injury, nor does the organization condemn Hamas and other Palestinian terror groups’ recruitment and use of children throughout the violence. The NGO also ignored the violent nature of the protests, which have consisted of an organized armed attack on the Israeli border and IDF positions, attempts to destroy and breach the border fence, and sustained arson, rocket, and mortar attacks on Israeli civilian communities.\"\n\n\n\"On May 18, 2018, Save the Children and the Palestinian Center for Democracy and Conflict Resolution sponsored a workshop at the Dar al Huda kindergarten, “Training of Teachers on Positive Discipline in Everyday Teaching.”\nOn May 26, 2018, the Dar al Huda kindergarten in Gaza held a graduation ceremony that included the mock killing and kidnapping of Israelis by children dressed as combatants.1 The simulation included sophisticated equipment such as drones, body cameras, military fatigues, body armor, and sniper camouflage. Children wore headbands representing Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), designated as a terrorist organization by the US, EU, and others.\"\n\n\n\"During the 2014 Gaza conflict, Save the Children published a full-page advertisement in papers throughout the UK of the names of Palestinian children who were killed; a similar list of Israeli children was not produced.\"\n\n\n\"Save the Children has repeatedly joined in the demonization campaign falsely accusing Israel of employing starvation as a method of warfare against Hamas. These allegations have been repeatedly shown to be based on fundamental methodological errors and overwhelmingly disproven by publicly available information.\"",

Attacks occurred at various locations, including shopping centers, public buses, transit stations, cafes, nightclubs, and restaurants, According to a 2006 study from the University of Haifa, only a few of the bombings targeted military objectives.

It looks very much like the prejudice against Jews is ACCEPTABLE  but if you dare say anything about what is happening in Africa, you will be silenced. \n\nJew bashing has become fashionable again, even though Israel fought back after being attacked by Hamas and men of Gaza, first. That was a brutal massacre of ordinary Israelis BTW. The Israeli response was and is brutal, but given the history of these people, the size of their country and where they are geographically and the attacks from ALL sides: it is no surprise. \n\nOh, and back on topic. Why are so many babies being born in Gaza? I’m guessing that there’s not much birth control available and I’m also thinking that the women are under immense pressure to breed. No different to the pressure put on women in the West, to breed after WW2.",

If by \"the situation in Iran\" one means the fall of the Mullah's, unfortunately that seems less and less in the cards at present.\n\n\\*However\\*, it does seem like Iran is going to stay in prolonged economic crisis for a while that will limit its ability to fund groups like Hamas, since of course between allocating money for this sort of thing and allocating it for IRGC paycheques it's sort of an obvious choice. It loses the latter well then now the regime \\*could\\* fall. So, all in all a diminished Hamas can sort of be expected, unless someone decides to now announce to foot the bills.\n\nAs for what changes, well that's difficult to say, since really it's a matter of how things shake out with the interim administration. Apparently, the head of the proposed interim admin has went and said he'd rebuild the place in 7 years and make new Gazan land by just pushing all the rubble into the sea (with bulldozers he doesn't have), \\*very\\* bold claims for a former deputy minister of of Transportation. It's important to note that Hamas used to operate with much less of a budget, but thrived because of the failures of the government it contended against. If the interim admin fares the same, well then people start saying \"man I miss Hamas\" then it's kinda back to square one, albeit in a much-diminished form.

But this cannot fully justify crippling millions of civilians. Statistically, terror attacks in Israel are relatively rare—comparable to rates of violent crime in developed countries—yet the collective restrictions placed on Palestinians vastly exceed the actual threat.\n\nTo say that Hamas “complicates governance” is an understatement. It’s a radical Muslim group which seeks to destroy Israel and make all of the land Muslim. The fact that the Israeli policy was to let them even exist as a neighbor and continue attacking for years, shows the mercy of Zionism. To let the Gazan regime exist at all, even under blockade, required a lot of restraint. Others wouldn’t even want such a neighbor at all and would have wiped them out by now. \n\n&gt;The economic and social disparity is heart-wrenching.\n\nWhat about Egyptians? Or Jordanians? They also have disparity with Israel. Israel is far above them. But why? There’s no occupation or blockade there. \n\nIt’s not like the Middle East is a thriving region and Israel is just bringing the Palestinians down. The region in general, is pretty bad, and Israel is the exception. So when you see lack of development in Palestine, that’s just the norm for that sort of people. They wouldn’t be advanced even without Israel.",

It's important to contextualize all this properly otherwise it's impossible to understand this.\n\nThe vast majority of Arabs in the region have, for nearly a century, maintained the position that they oppose ANY self determination of Jews on any part of their indigenous land. This is not a conflict based on borders. Arabs have maintained an ideological position informed by Islam, and more recently by Nazi ideology that persista in the Arab world. There is a reason why my Iraqi Jewish family was offered compensation by post-war Germany. The Nazis were VERY active in the region, the Palestinian/Arab leadership were their buddies. Just to setup the situation.\n\nJews are a small ethnic minority in the region surrounded by very large, powerful neighbors that have tried to destroy them multiple times to create their own Arab-dominated ethnostates. That is the status quo of the region.\n\nPalestinians today are brazen because these forces (Arab neighbors) will support them until the last Palestinian breathes. When your neighbor has the position \"either you die, or we die trying\", the conversation basically ends. \n\nWhat about the Israeli side? Surely the same rhetoric exists? Israeli leadership has swung between \"we must offer land for peace like we did with Egypt\" to \"we will do nothing. Offer nothing, and not impede settlers, until we have a partner on the other side willing to talk\". \n\nMeanwhile, Palestinian leadership has left their people with nothing. Arafat, who is considered to be one of Palestines greatest heroes, died a multibillionaire and left his people with nothing. Hamas leaders get fat in Qatar, and Fatah are making bank off the status quo. Even if Israel tried to go out of its way to give Palestinians land of their own, there isn't even a partner to negotiate with. If you care about Palestinians, start with fostering their leadership.",

However, it is not limited to the IL/PS conflict or because of it. The difference between the have and have not is not only due to conflicts. You can look at Africa for example, a lot of problems don't trace back to only wars. Israelis' economic success is not at the expense of Palestinians' ones, and the majority of Israel's exports are services. Of course you can still point out that Israel's security measures come at the expense of Palestinians' daily lives. But it doesn't affect the services (or digital) sector as it does manual labour. Both Israel and the Palestinian territories will never be physical exports powerhouses.\n\nNow what can you do? You as an individual maybe can support projects like Rawabi which help reach economic independence. However, in the long run it is not something that depends on individuals and more on the leadership of the Palestinians.",

From the very beginning of his Congressional career he encouraged his brother, and later his son, to become lobbyists whose main activity was corruptly selling access to him, which he profited from vicariously &amp; via family \"gifts.\" Biden later wrote the mass incarceration crime bill that put millions of non violent drug offenders behind bars. Some years after that Biden wrote the legislation to prevent people from discharging their credit card debt and most other personal debts through bankruptcy. Then at the end, while fueling a genocide he backed 100%, in an incredible show of selfish narcissism he clung to office while glaringly cognitively diminished by age which all but guaranteed him ushering Trump back into power.\n\nEvery president of my lifetime has been a complete villain, despite what their PR campaigns have tried to refute.

That is not a subtle thing they are literally pulling out the menorah out of the temple. Of course the antizionists like to pretend like none of this happened. \n\nThe Palestinains have no recollection of antiquity. Regardless, of course we are not allowed to debate their antiquity, because it's offensive to do so. We are not allowed to offend. But, they are allowed to insult us at the most basic level, to say we are fake people.

    "body": "You are painting Jews with a single broad stroke and conflating Zionism and Jewishness. I'm being direct, but I do not intend to be rude or combative.\n\nAnti-Zionists have an issue with Zionism. Christian Zionism arguably precedes Jewish Political Zionism, which birthed Israel, by a century, if not more. (Look up Puritanism, Pietism, Millininearism, Dispensationalism, and of course Evangelicalism)\n\n---\n\nRe: 1. This is a strawman argument. Jews have ties to Palestine. Palestinians have ties to Palestine. People with cultural and historic ties to a land can argue they should live in that land. I have no problem with that. I have a problem with how that aim was achieved by the dispossession and disenfranchisement of another people. The ethnic cleansing of 750,000 Palestinians from their homes. And a continued denial of their right to live in the land they have ties to.\n\nRe:2. I fundamentally disagree with your framing. All the way from the second Aliyah in 1904-14, Palestinians were aware that some nation building was taking place. Hence the prominent Christian Arab anti-Zionist publications Falastin and Al-Karmil in 1910s. Furthermore, the Hassan McMahon correspondence of 1915-16 and the Balfour declaration of 1917 upset many Palestinians. Add to that land purchases from absentee landlords, Jewish-only labor in settlements and you have a recipe for resentment.  It is in this context that some Palestinians resorted to violent protests in 1920s. I do not excuse any attacks on civilians, and I readily condemn any such acts. My criticism is in the *systemic*, *premeditated* violence perpetrated by Irgun, Haganah, Stern militias under the comicity of the Jewish Executive on a scale that left 750,000 Palestinians homeless and stateless.\n\nAny argument that justifies vilification of a whole people and excuses their suffering is calling for collective punishment, which is inherently reprehensible. You are doing that with Arabs, and others do that with Jews.",

So it wasn't really a paragon of self-determination. It was hobbled when the US representative recommended peacekeeping operations instead of enforcing the partition plan in Feb '48. Even before the British withdrawal, the Zionist Paramilitaries had started cleansing operations. For example, Plan Dalet was finalized in March of 1948.

Along with millions of Arabs including hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who have PRIMARILY European DNA... honestly I personally DGAF who has what DNA or who is mostly this or mostly that. I respect however people want to identify. I just can't help but call out the hypocrisy.\n\nI explained this on another thread\n\n\"Most Ottoman Elites INCLUDING countless Ottoman rulers WERE ETHNICALLY European... Period...\n\nMillions of Palestinians and other Arabs (not a majority, a large minority) are ALSO ETHNICALLY European. Not culturally. But their DNA was and is PRIMARILY European..\n\nThe Jewish Zionists were NEVER accepted as Europeans. Never. Never. Never. Jews were regularly told to \"go back to Palestine.\" They were NOT accepted.NEVER accepted as \"true\" Europeans...\n\nBut really, at the end of the day it doesn't matter. The Arab Muslims and Turks horrifically mistreated the Jews in their midst for countless centuries BEFORE Zionism\n\nTheir is a very common misconception that comes up when we talk about this subject. Honestly I don't care at all what ethnic background anyone has and I fully respect however they identify. That is how I feel.. But I feel like I need to talk about this because the pro-Palestine / anti-semites keep bringing this up... This is why I am talking about it. That is the only reason...\n\nIt is all very easy to understand once you spot the obvious. In the Arab and Turkish worlds, your ethnic background is considered to come from your father...\n\nSo let's, with a VERY simple example, see how this would play out. The Ottoman Turks preferred European wives. In the culture of the Oghuz Turks this was a non-issue. The ethnicity of the child was considered that of the father...\n\nSo let's look at this and make some VERY simple examples. It is the 11th century. An Oghuz Turkish man, looks and is ethnically 100% Asian and looks Asian... He has a child with a European woman. According to Ottoman and Arab culture, the child is 100% Oghuz Turk and is a full member of this tribe and is culturally a member of this group.\n\nBut GENETICALLY he is ONLY 50% Turkish. He is 50% Turkish and say, 50% Albanian or 50% Italian or whatever. So the son has some other leading position in the tribe or has some important position in the empire. Because the Ottomans PREFERRED European wives, HE gets a European wife, a woman who converted to Islam from say, the Caucuses or wherever. They have a child. Culturally the child is ALSO 100% Oghuz Turkish. But his DNA is NOW 75% European... you get it? Culture is not the same as DNA...",
