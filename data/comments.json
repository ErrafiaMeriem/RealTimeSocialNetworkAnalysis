You’ve seen these pictures of people cutting open the chest of an enemy, these Islamists, tearing out the heart. The person is still alive and eating the heart.” The reality, he argues, is that “Israel is defending itself, but in so doing, we’re defending Western civilisation.”\n\n\nHow is this not like the Jewish blood libel?

Zionism is using Judaism and is the biggest threat to it. Jews have lived in Palestine forever but it doesn't mean 5% turns into half a country. It's almost as if America and the West closed their doors purposely so all these refugees would go to Palestine. The problem was always European and should've been solved in Europe. This doesn't mean Jews can't live in Palestine. They are welcome and we're welcomed until the plans for Zionism were found. And you can't just build a country on top of another. No one is worth more than others. We are all equal. We haven't been there for generations. We have been there since the times of Canaan and most of us also have Israelite blood. It doesn't mean we could do the same if the roles were reversed. It's a shame because Palestinians didn't have a problems with Jews and actually welcomed them even before and after the Holocaust. Religion is sacred here and it's sacred because all must live together. Zionism was never about that. It was an atheist movement for Ashkenazim before the Holocaust ever happened. It was colonial and used self proclaimed terrorist groups like the Lehi, Stern, Hagana etc. who eventually became the Iof and government. This movement hijacked all religions because it had no respect for any including Judaism.",

I guess as a fellaha it allowed her to reuse the tatreez on a new dress should the fabric of the original be worn out or if she grew bigger. And I think she did that for a few decades because on some parts, the embroidery is very worn out, meanwhile the fabric of the dress was fine.  I was gifted her thobes after her passing away. As she was a heavy woman and I could never wear her thobes, I just had to unsew the pieces of embroidery. I have yet to resew the piece on a dress my size, but that might be a strategy that you want to explore too.",

It was just Jordanian territory. In 1967 Jordan joined a war against Israel and they lost. Israel took control of the territory because of that.\n\nWhen a nation starts a war and loses they often lose territory. This is a standard outcome of conflict throughout history.\n\nTake the Mexican-American War as an example. A significant portion of the current United States was Mexican territory. Mexico lost that land in a war. We do not look at a map today and say \"the US is occupying California\" or that they \"stole it from Mexico\". We acknowledge that borders shift as a result of wars.\n\nJordan eventually renounced its claims to the West Bank in 1988. So the narrative that this land was stolen ignores reality. It was captured in a defensive war from a country that had previously occupied it and lost.\n\nAt best any Jordanians (\"Palestinians) left in that region should move back to Jordan since that is the country who lost the land.",

That was the the principal source of rising support for the Palestinians and rising hostility to Israel's tactics. \n\nHowever, the doesn't mean there's been been some dramatic re-evaluation of the Palestinian cause more generally. With respect to the Palestinians, most people, 1) don't care, 2) care, but not enough to get off the couch, 3) don't understand the issues involved, or 4) think the Palestinians deserve at least some of what they get. \n\nThose on the hard left -- or in the developing world or in the Muslim world -- who are fervent supporters of Palestinian rights (and there are a lot of them, no doubt) are about to experience a whole lot of disappointment. They misinterpret public sentiment. Things will almost certainly return to the status quo ante very shortly, and then we'll all go through exactly the same thing we just went through 25 years from now, and then 25 years after that, and so on. Globally, most people understand intuitively that the Middle East is a nexus of problems and issues that will never be solved. It's the same reason people in the West never got too wound up about all the killing in Syria, in Iraq, or wherever. They know that's the nature of the Middle East and they know it will never end. They don't want to be too involved in it or connected to it, and they want to forget about it as soon as they're humanly able. \n\nSo anybody who thinks there's been some dramatic shift that means \"liberation\" for the Palestinians is at hand, I would suggest that that's very, very unlikely. People in the West just don't care enough, and people in the rest of the world don't have the ability to effect the sort of change supporters of the Palestinians are looking for.",

In fact, the Arab powers at the time took advantage of the restrictions placed by Britain over Jews, making it so that they couldn’t immigrate to Eretz Israel in the years leading up to the Holocaust, by encouraging Muslims to move to the holy land (which is why the population more than doubles from 1890-1914). This proves a difficult one to balance with the arguments over Aliyah and granting Jewish-Israeli citizenship. At least half of the Palestinians of 1948 were immigrants or their descendants. \n\nMy issue on arguing about who got there first, who colonised who yada yada is that it’s absolutely pointless when you consider the immigration rates. Regardless of who has more Canaanite/Levantine DNA, both groups are largely just immigrants with no personal claim to the land beyond the agreements/consequences of war and policy granting them it. They have distinct attachments to the land and their own, valid reasons for wanting it too. \n\nThe only thing that should matter is current affairs with consideration of the current politics and recent history, given they call it home and may have done since living memory recalls. All this ‘we got there first!’ crap is juvenile. Both sides are very guilty of letting this be the Crown Jewels of their stance, causing major disagreement and bias that is essentially irrelevant. Nobody wants to answer the question of what would happen if one gets kicked out because the other ‘wins.’ And yet here we are, still arguing about who had it first, as if nothing else matters.",

It's on migration routes between Africa, Europe, Asia and the ME. It had been conquered and reconquered more times than I can count. Each causing displacement and migration. \n\nThe modern-day Palestinians are descendents of the impacts of that. I'm sure many can trace their genetics to the area for thousands of years. Some are much newer arrivals.\n\nJews mostly left at the hands of the Romans. They were at the mercy of the host countries. To some success, and major tragedy. They won the rights to govern the land by declaration of the Colonial powers. The Palestinians were dispersed as a result of an Arab war of genocidal intent. The Nakba is real. However, most usually fail to accept that the Palestinians were kept as perpetual refugees at the hands of Arabs.\n\nJordan was intended to be the Palestinian state, than then they added the WB and Gaza. It was not enough. The Arabs started a war to get the rest, and lost. Between 48 and 67, Jordan and Egypt could have made the WB &amp; Gaza Palestinian. They did not. Jordan, Syria and Jordan could have absorbed and resettled Palestinians. They did not.\n\nThey Palestinians that ended up staying have full and equal rights in Israel and arguably have the best quality of life for Arabs in MENA. The Palestinians in Lebanon and Syria have limits on where they can live, what profession they can do, etc.\n\nThere were many Palestinians made refugees during the Nakba. There were slightly more Jews made refugees from Arab and Moslims countries at the same time. Israel took them in and absorbed them.\n\nOne group was trying to make the best of things, the other was used as a weapon. You can see the unfortunate results.\n\nObviously, there is much, much more to it. But I can't write an encyclopedia on Reddit.",

By 1948, there were 1.5 million. People forget that the whole “making the desert bloom” thing is real. Palestine really was mostly desert and malaria-infested swamps until the First Aliyah (1880-1903). Those Jews drained the swamps and implemented responsible land management and once it was proven the land could be profitable, more people from the surrounding areas began moving in. Most of the “Palestinian refugees” from the war of independence were there for less time than the First Aliyah Jews were. Thats not even to mention the Old Yishuv Jews. People also forget that the total number of Arabs expelled from Israel after they lost the war is fewer than the number of Jews expelled from Arab countries after the war.",

Let's remember the last time the USA dwelled into Iran's politics they chose to believe their s... ambassador, he was so full of himself, and bought Khomeini's lies, and never apologized for betting at wrong horse, so I would say they are going to think it many times over before doing anything.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm going to be very surprised if neither the CIA nor the Mossad are already propping the people demonstrating in some capacity but openly doing anything? It goes beyond everything the USA does post W. Bush, Trump closes bases, he does not open them, and the further they are about to go are the Americas: their backyard. The USA can already manage over 60% of their oil needs, why messing with Iran when they can get that off Venezuela? Notwithstanding the fact Brazil is heading to a change later this year which would make their reserves available, I'm Argentinian so thanks to our production we can help a bit too, same goes for gas. It might have been an issue in both the 70s and 80s but the USA needn't Iran that much but would have love for a regime change. In any case as a lot of people said here already the locals need to do their bit, it's pointless otherwise.\n\nAs for Israel's, I'm going to be very surprised if this does not play exactly into their aims: Hamas is mostly beaten and they didn't make the same mistake of retreating off Gaza as they did in 2005 without proper reassurances, in any case the yellow line would end up becoming the new border with Gaza. As predicted they lost more territory yet again.  \nHezbollah is gone, Israel took more land in Syria and is propping the Druzes so they can go full independent and create a state buffer they can be friends with, Jordan isn't an issue anymore nor is Egypt (although they were of course helping the Gazan in an informal way). Getting rid of the Iranian's menace even if it means getting them off the board for the next years would be a huge coup for them.\n\nAs for the \"Pali\" cause is yet another nail in their delusional coffin.",

I can only speak with great clarity on what I want, and what people I know, who have been willing to share with me, want.\n\nIt should be obvious to anyone that what an indigent parent in Gaza burying their fifth child prioritizes will often be quite different than what an enormously wealthy Palestinian expat prioritizes or what a Christian college-aged student native to a Western country prioritizes.\n\nIt should similarly be obvious to anyone that an Israeli grandfather who lost a child to a bus bombing will have different priorities than a fourth-generation Jewish-American that has never experienced meaningful antisemitism or a Christian fundamentalist preacher who believes Jesus will only return if the Jews control the Holy Land.\n\nUltimately, however, we do have to recognize that most people who care enough about this conflict to talk about it on social media are going to be very distrustful of anything that looks one-sided in favor of \"their side.\"  The sad reality is that almost anything you can criticize from either side has a \"yes, but isn't that a reaction to...\" until we're talking about provoking incidents from thousands of years ago, because the seeds of this conflict really were planted that long ago.\n\nThe people in charge of Israel don't trust anyone but Jewish people to safeguard the long-term interests of Jewish people, not after thousands of years of antisemitism.  I believe that is a justified fear, and I can't really imagine that changing in my lifetime, because there were periods of safety for Jewish people in places for longer than one lifetime until suddenly there was existential danger.  This certainly doesn't mean that I agree with every policy decision made by Israeli leadership nor does it mean that I don't have sympathy for Palestinian suffering.  But very little of that criticism or sympathy is going to show up in a conversation with someone who doesn't acknowledge and respect that existential fear, and understand why things like a one-state solution that leads to an Islamic majority or the formation of an armed Palestinian state with leadership that has promised and continues to promise our destruction just isn't on the table.  If we're going to talk about actual peace, not just a brief respite before the next explosion, there has to have a convincing answer to the question of Jewish safety.\n\nAnd similarly, although I have less of a personal connection to the Palestinians than I do my fellow Jewish people, any real peace has to address a number of very legitimate Palestinian grievances in some meaningful way that makes them feel safe as well.  I don't expect them to \"just trust Israel\" to protect them any more than I expect Israel to \"just trust\" them.",

If you look at your post insights you can see the demographics. When I do so i see people from Israel is like below 10%. It varies by post though. \n\nIf you want to see what Israelis think there is the YouTube channel the ask project by Corey Gil Shuster.  He asks random people on the street their opinion and it’s variable. He asks both Israelis and Palestinians which may be of interest to you. \n\nPersonally though I think the opinions of both Israelis and Palestinians are pretty hardened and not really poised for any mutual understanding anytime soon. \n\nThere are of course Israelis though who don’t buy the Palestinian = Hamas language anymore after serving in IDF during the war. And there are those in Gaza living in the rubble who don’t care about the Palestinian fight anymore and just want to live normal lives. Between these two people I think there is hope for an end to hostilities. \n\nYes this sub has become entrenched in the idea of Palestinian = Hamas probably as a reaction to the overwhelming pro-Palestinian chant of genocide that pretty much all of Reddit has taken up except for a few subs like this one. It’s not really a good thing though because there is a difference between Palestinians and Hamas. It’s just that Hamas didn’t wear uniforms during the war which blurred the lines between soldier and civilian. And made IDF desensitized, put civilians at risk, and made for many harsh rules to protect IDF soldiers. \n\nYou are probably right Israel will want to win, take land if they can. It may not totally be up to Israel at this point though they are a sovereign nation, they are still pretty much the little brother to America. \n\nI feel like at this point it is an Israel or Palestine situation though—the two peoples cant live together and both want to dominate. It is not ideal but maybe it is inevitable anyway for there to be a winner and a loser.",

We'll just call them 'Outsiders' and \"Insiders'  \n  \nAnd the end goals of these two groups are very diffrent.  \n  \nThe Outsider, will say something like 'We want just one secular state where everyone can be free' That same Outsider will reply if asked, \"what sort of government would that be?\"  and it likely to say very vague or perhaps \"Well that up to the Palestinians, they will have to decide\"    \nIn other words the 'Outsider Pro Palestinian'  does not see any responsibility on what happens if the 'one state' becomes a nightmare for the 'former' Israelis. They wash their hands of the consequences, or quietly (or loudly) think that what the Zionists deserve, and they brought in on themselves.  So even if 100% of the Outsiders want a peaceful new perfected State with everyone happy and peaceful, they still bow to the 'Insiders' to decide exactly how 'peaceful' that new State will be.\n\nSo lets look at the 'Insiders', that will be the Palestinians that will actually 'take over' perhaps even run it as some class of democracy. The people who would actually 'live' and 'run' this new 'perfected' State.  Do the 'Insiders' believe in co-existence? Are there Polls that can tell us how peaceful they would be if they were in charge? We like to pretend its 'just Hamas' but Hamas is a symptom of a culture that accepts and even celebrates the current violence. Polls still show super majority of the Palestinians in both Gaza and West Bank support the actions of 'Hamas' so even if Hamas disappeared tomorrow and some new group arose to take the lead to 'run' this new imaginary One State, the fundamental beliefs in violence as the solution will not have been exercised. The new 'State' would soon become a bloody civil war that makes the last few years look peaceful. \n\nAnd the 'Outsiders' will have no influence or even interest in cooling this violence. They will probably ignore it for some other newer cause of the day. \n\n  \n(BTW I personally despise the violent Settlers in the WB and wish Israel would withdraw to the 67 lines, but just as so many Palestinian supporters excuse the violence of the Palestinian's as 'natural reaction to years of oppression'  I have seen with the fading of hope for peace, the violent Settlers are just the 'natural reaction to years of Palestinian hate' It goes both ways.)",

The suffering is real and tragic, but it's also the deliberate product of leadership that has rejected every peace offer since 1937 because maintaining the conflict serves their interests far better than actually building a state, and the international community keeps rewarding this strategy by treating Palestinians as permanent victims who bear no responsibility for their choices. You want to discuss less harm and more freedom for everyone, which sounds noble, but you can't have that conversation without acknowledging *that one side has repeatedly chosen violence* while the other has built a functioning democracy under constant threat of annihilation. \n\nThis may come shocking to you but Israel didn't get handed a state on a platter either, they *fought for* it and *built it* with whatever meagre resources they had while being blockaded and attacked by every neighbor who wanted them destroyed. The Jews who survived the Holocaust didn't start launching rockets into Germany or running around Europe killing people in the streets. they took their trauma and built a prosperous nation. So when you wonder why Israelis get defensive when you express concern for Palestinian suffering, it's because that framing ignores that Palestinians are the architects of their own future and nobody's going to give them a state when they've spent 75 years proving they'd rather destroy Israel than build alongside it.\n\nIf you actually want what's best for Palestinians, stop treating them like children who can't be held accountable and start encouraging them to look in the mirror and embrace some harsh realities, ***like the fact that their betterment isn't based on how much Israel suffers***, that their lives matter more than revenge, and that building a future together with Jews requires convincing the Israeli people they're genuine partners for peace rather than massaging the egos of religious nutjobs and anti-Western dictators who use them as pawns. You came here looking for understanding and got defensive responses because many Israelis are exhausted with people who express concern for Palestinian suffering while ignoring or dismissing the context that created it, and yeah that's tribal and defensive, but when your existence has been under threat since day one and the world constantly judges you by standards applied to no other nation, you tend to get a bit sensitive about people implying both sides are equally responsible when the evidence shows otherwise.",

Losing hope is what extremists want you to do.\n\n I generally think the unreasonableness you describe is a general feature of human discourse (and to all the pro-Israelis reading this, yes this includes the Pro-Palestine side as well). Not every movement will be made up of unreasonable people to the same extent as others, but I think every major movement has them. Ironically, pretending like one side is made up of purely reasonable people is engaging in the exact tribalistic attitude you describe.\n\nAt the same time, I think we should remember that online voices are more extremist than the real world, and try not to let it get us down too much. Both sides have a vested interest in making the other side seem more extremist than they really are\n\n&gt;What I think will happen: Israel will take Gaza, or at least a sizable portion of it, and displace Palestinians. Those in the West Bank will never have a sovereign country. They will eventually be killed or removed as well, possibly following another attack or just slowly by Israeli extremist provicateurs. Isreal will “win”, whatever that may mean. There will never be peace, because there is no reason for it.\n\nI think this is spot on.

This issue above all others will dictate the solution that we must adopt. In the absence of a negotiated agreement – and I do not believe in the realistic prospect of an agreement – we need to implement a unilateral alternative... More and more Palestinians are uninterested in a negotiated, two-state solution, because they want to change the essence of the conflict from an Algerian paradigm to a South African one. From a struggle against 'occupation,' in their parlance, to a struggle for one-man-one-vote. That is, of course, a much cleaner struggle, a much more popular struggle – and ultimately a much more powerful one. For us, it would mean the end of the Jewish state... the parameters of a unilateral solution are: **To maximize the number of Jews; to minimize the number of Palestinians**; not to withdraw to the 1967 border and not to divide Jerusalem... Twenty-three years ago, Moshe Dayan proposed unilateral autonomy. On the same wavelength, we may have to espouse unilateral separation... [it] would inevitably **preclude a dialogue with the Palestinians for at least 25 years.**\n\n(Landau, D. ‘Maximum Jews, Minimum Palestinians’: Ehud Olmert speaks out. *Haaretz.* November 13, 2003.)\n\n---\n\nDov Weissglass, **senior adviser to PM Sharon**:\n\n&gt; **The significance of the disengagement plan is the freezing of the peace process,** and when you freeze that process, you prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, and you prevent a discussion on the refugees, the borders and Jerusalem. Effectively, this whole package called the Palestinian state, with all that it entails, has been removed indefinitely from our agenda. And all this with authority and permission. All with a presidential blessing and the ratification of both houses of Congress. That is exactly what happened. You know, the term 'peace process' is a bundle of concepts and commitments. The peace process is the establishment of a Palestinian state with all the security risks that entails. **The peace process is the evacuation of settlements, it's the return of refugees,** it's the partition of Jerusalem. And all that has now been frozen... **what I effectively agreed to with the Americans was that part of the settlements would not be dealt with at all, and the rest will not be dealt with** ***until the Palestinians turn into Finns.*** That is the significance of what we did.\n\n(Shavit, A. Top PM aide: Gaza plan aims to freeze the peace process. *Haaretz*. October 6, 2004.)\n\n***\n\nSo, the purpose of the 2005 \"Disengagement\" Plan—as stated by its architects—was to prevent the coalescence of a unified movement for Palestinian statehood.",

Everyone in a position of enough leadership they'd be held accountable for bad real-world outcomes, is very comfortable smashing transnational ideological \"resistance\" movements with Israel's inexhaustible help.

This is likely from the story of Jacob, renamed Israel which means \"He who struggles with God\" for the story of him wrestling an angel or God depending on who you talk to.\n\nBut as far as how I think language could be used for this... Palestine is the whole region, Israel is part of it, West Bank and Gaza are also part of it. This just makes it easier. Israel is in Palestine, and Palestine is like saying \"Pacific Northwest\" for like Portland and Seattle etc... It's just easier this way imo since Palestine has never been a nation state.\n\nBut I find it really... interesting that the earliest mention of Palestine carries the same meaning as the word Israel.

    "body": "it's a good post because you're touching on one of the main issues. There are two narratives here. \n\nOne is the Jewish people narrative. Jews have lived in the Land of Israel and Judea for 3000+ years. Jews have a rich history, they had a nation here, Jerusalem is their capital, and Jews have fought to get their country back. And everything Jews did in pursuit to get their country back was also legitimate - they did fight for it against occupiers but they also had the international law justification. Similar to the US vs the  British and the Treaty of Paris.  Jews are a people with a religion and the religion revolves around Eretz Yisrael and therefore Zionism is inherently linked to Judaism and it is not a seperate thing. There are Jews that disagree but there were also redcoats, Uncle Toms etc in every Nation's struggle. As things evolved there is one Jewish state and 20+ Arab states and 50+ Islamic states. many of these states were created with total disregard to any actual peoples like Kurds or Berbers or Arameans or Maronites or Balouchis or Druze, and there is no justification in the world to attack and blame and scapegoat the one tiny Jewish state in the whole world.\n\nThe other narrative is the Palestinian. Here the idea is that even if Jews had a nation in the past in the meantime there were other things happening in the same area which they now prefer to call Palestine. And even these Jews were just a religion so really everything is Palestinian people even if they never called it as such. What they also want to say without saying it too loudly is that because the entire area was ruled by Islam then it became dar al-Islam and must remain under Islamic rules. Jews can live as dhinmis but never as sovereign. Jerusalem while never even a district capital, lower than Ramle, under Islamic rule, is now retroactively classified as important to Islam just like every place Islam conquered. The Temple Mount is now the the site of Muhammad's ascent to Heaven. Because they can say so.  So under this general narrative you have to ignore the fact it's part of Arab and Islam conquest but to pretend for a second that its all about an indigenous Palestinian population that has been subjugated and oppressed by the colonizing White Man which in this case is somehow actually the Jews. And just to reinforce it, the narrative is that the Jews in this case are not even Jews. They might be Khazars. Or Polish. And they were and still are illegally supported by the Empires like the British (even though history says exactly the opposite but you have to look at the big picture).  Easy to insert to this narrative also the Jewish cabals and elders of zion stuff because the theory is that Israel only exists under this narrative because of Jewish control of the media and of course the USA.\n\nThat's the two narratives and people can decide which one is more relatable according to their understandings.",

Thanks for sharing your perspective, friend.\n\nLoved that you brought up Eretz Yisrael and I really appreciated your mention of Dar al-Islam, it’s a sharp historical lens that highlights how Islamic governance traditionally entailed that non-Muslims could live in the territory but were not sovereign. It also helps explain why some historical and ideological currents among Palestinians aim to limit or disenfranchise non-Islamic subjects, in particular Jews. These two ideologies were destined to be at odds with one another. Perhaps we were doomed centuries ago.\n\nAt the same time, I think the narrative as you describe it leans a bit heavily on that religious framing. There are many Palestinians today who articulate their claims through a secular, nationalist, or human-rights frame rather than in explicitly religious or legalistic ones. And many Israelis truly do view these people as subhuman, no legal/moral arguments to be had. Reducing the Palestinian narrative mainly to Islamic supremacy risks oversimplifying the diversity of perspectives and motivations that exist.\n\nI do agree with your broader point: both sides are defending deeply structured existential narratives, not just policies or land. Recognizing the selective nature of these narratives shaped by memory, trauma, and shifting sociopolitical dynamics doesn’t delegitimize either side, but it does help explain why the conversation is so charged and resistant to simplification.",

But I think ultimately it will always go back to the core, because there are enough religious people out there. You cannot actually be a secular Muslim and we can try and reform Islam like many critics of Islam out there say so (and I get it, you could make some claims against certain orthodox Judaism as well), but it is going to fail. It will fail because it takes a small number of people to destroy it. So even if you assume it will be a small number, all it takes is a little bit of terror with devastating effects, and it will go really south. I saw that during the Oslo Accords in the 90s. The Israeli government kept claiming that it is only Hamas (and Islamic Jihad) and that these groups like Hamas are enemies of peace. But Israelis kept dying in horrible ways from suicide bombings, so the argument seemed ludicrous and many /most people in Israel could not really fathom why they were in the peace process to begin with. And unfortunately it's not a small number. I think over 90% of Palestinians believe in this Islamic dogma against Israel, and it is reinforced day after day in Mosques, whether in the Middle East or other countries.  So remember the denazzification after World War 2 in Germany. That's a really high bar to do let's say in Gaza.  And therefore this conflict will remain inherently religious.\n\nAnd good job mentioning the trauma. That is indeed a driving force to the conflict where many people, in my opinion, simply ignore the deep decades long trauma for Israeli people (irrespective of Holocaust etc. just in Israel/Palestine itself.)",

Israel is the more indigenous true name but it doesn't mean Palestine has to be an antagonistic name to Jews, you're right. It's insulting in some ways (which is why, wisely, EY short for Eretz Yisrael, was added to the official name of the British Mandate) but it is also a modern English name. It is only after the PLO founded in 1964 that they started this so called Palestinian conflict and Free Palestine etc. Palestine was constantly refered by people as land of the Jews before 1948 and UN planned to have a Jewish state and an Arab state IN PALESTINE. And that was perfectly fine before definitions got confused. Each country would have been welcome to choose their name.

That’s because *support [somebody]* has two meanings, which *can* overlap, but can also completely contradict each other. “Support” can mean subjective support from the recipient’s perspective: praise, validation, platforming, and no-strings donations of exactly what they ask for. But “support” can also mean *objective* support, by giving the recipient not what they seek or say they seek, but what they *clearly and logically would benefit from*, whether they asked for it, or will appreciate it, or not.\n\nNote that the most common and low-effort type of support known as “raising awareness” can fall into either category.\n\nIn medicine, a patient’s chief complaint (the reason they say they’re here) is always written verbatim in the visit note. That’s because whether or not it’s true at face value, the words the patient chose are nevertheless a valuable clue as to how this patient thinks and communicates, how he conceptualizes the problem, and what the problem, and his hoped-for way of treating it, means to him.",

Give them a reason to care about what happens to you, and find yourself a reason to care about what happens to them! If you just look for it you will find someone just like you but on the other side who deserves that kindness and who thinks you deserve it too. I promise.\n\n\nLet go of all the hatred and pain. It's harming you and it's harming your neighbors. Hatred and pain have never brought anything good to anyone ever. It's a sickness, it's not a solution.\n\n\nSet a good example for others to follow! Show people how to forgive and how to build trust, compassion and mutual respect! Don't wait around for your political leaders on either side to do that because they won't until you show them with your actions that it is the right thing to do, and also that it is politically feasible, that it's not a death sentence for either party and that the true will of the people is peace, friendship and mutual dignity. \n\n\nFind common ground, find something to joke about with your would-be enemy and laugh together. \nShare food. Meet each other's grandparents, the grandparents who are tough as nails who survived so much. On both sides. They are not enemies, they have so much in common with each other and they deserve a chance to see you thrive together like good neighbors. The kind of neighbors who check on you when you're sick and drive you to the hospital if you're not doing good and bring you food when you're grieving.\n\n\nDemand peace.\nDemand forgiveness.\nDemand that all the old grievances be left behind in the past and forgotten.\nDemand mutual recognition and respect.\nDemand mutual coordination and security for partnerships, both public and private sector.\nDemand cooperation and direct regular personal meetings and phonecalls between leaders and representatives from both sides in good faith and goodwill.\n\n\nIf you can do that, this problem will solve itself and the world will be a better place.",

From the Umayyads to the Abbasids, to maybe even the Ottoman empire, after Islamic colonialism and the Early Muslim Conquests initiated by Muhammad, one religious group ruled. Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians (to some extent) on the other hand, were grouped under \"dhimmi status\"; second class citizens who had to pay the Jizya tax. Treated like an afterthought while the Muslims got all the history written about.\n\nA clear representation of Muslim superiority began to be challenged after significant Ottoman losses (for example, in Vienna) and the end of the Golden Age of Islam. Now, the Ottoman empire was being outcompeted by their European, majority Christian neighbors and regarded as the \"sick man of Europe\". But at the very least, Muslim peoples still ruled over the Middle East, the status quo stayed.\n\nWW1 shattered this reality, now these lands were occupied by European colonialists, complete foreigners with silly accents and sh#tty food /s. Now, a struggle for independence ensured, led through the plentiful Arab revolts in the Middle East.\n\nEventually, European powers got tired of holding on to the land, and in 1947 the UN decided to divide the land known as \"Palestine\" between Arabs and Jews. Completely unacceptable. For centuries, Muslims ruled over it, this was a perceived sign of weakness among the people; that a minority group they once dominated over was seemingly one upping them. The newly established Arab countries attacked the newly born Israel shortly after, only to lose. Hundreds of thousands were displaced.\n\nThis is the problem in my opinion, I bet they are often thought about the Islamic Golden Age and the Conquests, viewing it as a source of pride, a source of superiority, which is challenged in modern times now that a Jewish state was created after losing a humiliating war. This is the reason why so many cannot grasp that Jews are indigenous. A good chunk do hold such view.",

    "body": "I think your comments conflate a lot of things and state inaccuracies. Sorry if this reads as combative. Not my intent. I'll address just one point which you devoted most time to: peoplehood and nationhood.\n\nThe very notion of a nation state appeared in the 18th and 19th centuries when nation states were forming everywhere. Pan Arab nationalism picked up as the Ottomans were collapsing. Finally with the partitioning of Syria, Jordan and Palestine by the British and French (Sykes Picot agreement, San Romeo), and Zionism becoming increasingly prominent, the nationalist movement picked up on earnest. None of this was \"invented\" by the Soviets. What the Bolsheviks did was leak the agreement, causing much dismay amongst the Arabs due to earlier promises by the British.\n\nIn the same way, there was no such thing as a Jewish nation. There was a concept of the Jewish people, absolutely. Jews in Europe in fact wanted to emphasize assimilation and not confuse peoplehood with statehood for fear of accusations of disloyalty. Sadly this is what happened in Europe (Dreyfus affair for e.g). This antisemitism caused the Nationalism movements to pick up, including Zionism, Jewish Territorialism etc.\n\nSo, no, neither Zionists nor Palestinians are ancient nations. And yes, Jews are an ancient people. And yes, Palestinians have lived in Palestine for millennia. They had an evolving culture based on whichever empire was ruling them and started developing a national identity by the end of the 19th century. In any case, they did not deserve to be ethnically cleansed for nation building.",

I'm arguing that Zionism and Palestinian nationalism were spurred by the events of the 18-19th centuries, which is typically considered the age of natiom states. It was a new call for nationhood, not a continuity of an ancient polity.\n\nThere is only a shallow parallel with Canadian First nations. They continue to live in the nation state that disenfranchised them. The Rashiduns, Umayyads, Abbassids, Mamluks, Crusaders, Ottomans and later the British were not the inheritors of Romans. So any attempt to make a nation in Palestine would necessarily be a new conflict.\n\nThe Zionist Movement sought to displace native Palestinians from their native homeland by coercion if necessary, which ultimately resulted in violence. This possibility was already part of the Zionist Congresses starting in 1897. There is no question that Arabs - outside Palestine and inside - also perpetrated violence. But I will argue that that violence, whether or not justified, did not happen in a vacuum, but on the threat of Palestinians loosing their homes and asirations of nationhood. (Falastin, Al-Karmil were popular anti-Zionist papers started by Palestinian Christians in 1910s and will give you a good idea of the discourse).",

I first noticed this among Japanese, but have since seen it in observantly Orthodox Jews and frankly most Arabs I’ve encountered: far less openness to, and expectation of, forming new close human relationships in adulthood, compared to mainstream American society. Instead, adulthood is more for cultivating and maintaining the close relationships I have already made, with the handful of people fate threw me together with as a child.\n\nAs a Westerner born-and-raised, I don’t relate. But I sure can see this logically: if I had to get along with the same cohort of people, whom I never chose and cannot disrespect (never mind alienate!), I sure would “go along to get along” with everything *my people* thought and believed and taught me.

The fact that they don't take this simple step before spreading false information about the Hebrew language means that they probably don't care what is true. When you take on a conspiracy theory like that, you aren't simply something who didn't hear the truth.

The deeper into and more committed to their echo chamber a person is, the less likely they are to tolerate more than the most transactional of interactions with people whose own reality tunnels are incompatible with theirs. And negation of Team Israel’s preferred narrative, and opposition to Team Israel’s collective goal, are rather central to Team Palestine’s preferred narrative / reality tunnel / basic worldview.\n\nThink of it this way. Both ethnic groups, both of which were founded in the Levant and descend from its aboriginal inhabitants, are working with *many of* the same set of historical data points. But they play connect-the-dots with them very differently. The two tribes draw the lines of causal connection between these historico-folkloric landmarks in time without any collaboration with, and limited reference to, each other’s efforts. And when taking into consideration the data points the two groups *don’t* share in common, it’s no wonder they end up seeing, and drawing, two completely different pictures with the points in front of them.\n\nI’ll not speak for anyone else. In my judgement, after lengthy consideration, Team Israel makes a much stronger case for the connect-the-dots picture they drew corresponding to the objective reality that none of us are privy to.\n\nBut Team Palestine is committed. They’re *all in*, and have been agged on to be all-in by some powerful moneyed interests for generations now.To give up his preferred narrative / reality tunnel would be a very ungrounding and socially alienating experience for most members of Team Palestine. So they do they only thing they can do: assume the Israeli preferred narrative is build entirely on lies, misinformation, wishful thinking, and justification of what has no justification. And they double down. Because true or not, the Israeli side of the story utterly unacceptable, corrosive of all they live and breathe for, and a disgrace to the loved ones’ lives lost and great sacrifices already made.",

At the beginning of Zionism c.1900, notables like Yousef al-Khalidi said “Who can deny the rights of Jews to Palestine? … historically, it is indeed your country! … But … let Palestine alone … there are places yet uninhabited where millions of unfortunate Israelites could be settled …”  ￼\n\nIn 1930 the Muslim Waqf which maintains the holy sites published a tourist guide to the Al Aqsa Temple Mount which matter of factly stated it was built over the ruins of the Jewish Second Temple and the Western Wall aka al-Buraq was a Temple retaining wall (though they of course did not say that qualified that as a current Jewish holy or prayer site and there were frequent clashes about prayers at the Wall at the time).\n\nNow the official line is that the Jews were *never there* and the Israel Antiquities Authority archaeology projects which they’ve always opposed are either:\n\n(1) a nefarious plot to physically undermine or blow up the Al Aqsa and Temple Mount, an obsessive delusion going back to the first British and French archaeologists c. 1870 who were admittedly in those days often borderline tomb robbers and too liberal with TNT,\n\n—OR—\n\n(2) A deception of the Jews to plant fake artifacts to gin up their phony claims about ever existing in Jerusalem.\n\nArchaeology was and is one of the main points of friction in Jerusalem.  Significantly and surprisingly, some of the biggest archeological finds ever in Jerusalem, indeed in the world today, are ongoing in the Silwan neighborhood near City of David [as described in a 2022 article by Andrew Lawler in Archaeology Magazine](https://files.constantcontact.com/e43a44f1401/a696699e-da2b-44bd-8056-f6f8010215c0.pdf).\n\nI spent a week in 2024 as a volunteer laborer at the IAA Givati Dig and was shown around some of the other newer areas being excavated like the ancient pilgrimage road up the mountain to the Temple from Herod’s time buried under 65 feet of fill recently opened to the public since I was there and the huge mikvah at the foot of the road.  It’s absolutely mind blowing to me that all of this stuff from 800BCE can be pulled from the earth to begin with and that some of the greatest finds are happening right now in 2026 as we speak.

Just because someone in England or France says \"Allahu Akbar\" or \"Inshallah\", doesn't make it part of common English or French. It's still Arabic.\n\nThere is actually surprisingly little influence of Arabic on modern Hebrew than one could expect under the circumstances.\n\nAs to similarity, as it is the case for all related languages, it depends on circumstances. There are occasions when one could be genuinely surprised by how similar some sentences may sound. They are however not anywhere close to being mutually intelligible. Very broadly speaking, when language splits into two dialects, they remain mutually intelligible for about 1,000 years of separate development; there are 4k-5k years separating Hebrew and Arabic; that's a lot.\n\nIn theory, someone intelligent, very proficient in Hebrew (including rarely used and archaic roots), and knowing 100-200 common Arabic words and basic grammar, given enough time, with considerable difficulty, but may be able to understand the broad meaning of written Arabic text (and probably vice versa). \n\nSo two languages are related, far beyond being mutually intelligible, with a number of loan words in Hebrew which came from Arabic. \"Extremely similar\" is probably is exaggeration.",

It just talks about it as a political anti-Zionist identity claimed by Arabs who happen to live in the physical area of the historic Ottoman vilayet of Palestine. (and spends a lot of time talking about elite qur'anic scholarship in Jerusalem for some reason, which really seems more like an argument for a lack of a separate identity than in favor of one). \n\nHis only real disagreement with my post above is that he declares the identity as starting earlier (ie to the first Aliyah). I wouldn't necessarily even argue this, it's more a matter of terminology: there was obviously Arab violence toward Jews from the start, it's just that their nationalism transitioned from being more Pan-Arabic to being about a specific 'Palestinian' nation in the 60s.\n\nBut it's still purely political.",

Massive, sweeping changes that modern Hebrew speakers struggle to even comprehend without good education.\n\nModern Hebrew has past tense, present tense, future tense as conjugations. Ancient Hebrew didn't even have temporal tenses, and the conjugations that are used today existed but meant entirely different things. The modern present tense form of a verb corresponds to the participle form in Hebrew. So \"Walk\" as a verb in modern Hebrew would mean \"walker\" in old Hebrew. Also verbs were conjugated not just by who did them but also whom they affected. So a verb in ancient Hebrew is, long story short, only comprehensible as a root to someone who only knows modern Hebrew. You would not know the difference between \"Knowledge,\" \"He knew it,\" \"They will know,\" \"knower,\" \"Unknown...\" You would just be able to identify the basic root and maybe a few bits of the information around it. So if a modern Hebrew speaker without good education reads ancient Hebrew, it's a sort of soup of mostly familiar words from which they can extract basic meaning but can't really understand what the relationships are between the things. And while basic narrative texts would be understandable, the laws and the poems of ancient Hebrew are basically mumbo-jumbo if you aren't a serious scholar.\n\nHowever, this assumes a modern Hebrew speaker with no knowledge of ancient Hebrew. This basically doesn't exist.\n\nModern Hebrew speakers tend to be quite well educated, and if they aren't it's because they're super religious. So they will have had a lot of exposure to ancient Hebrew and end up getting used to it. All the important parts have been repeated so many times that you probably know them basically anyway.\n\nBut saying it's \"basically the same with minor changes\" is wild.",

There is some shared cultural ancestry for Eastern Slavic peoples that goes back to the Kievan Rus, but that was a state centered in Kiev, so if you are going to use that as an argument, you could as easily claim Russia should be a part of Ukraine. \n\nIn any case, after the Mongol conquest of Ruthenia, and then then decline of the Mongol empire (and the Golden Horde), present day Ukraine came mostly under control of first the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and then the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth from the mid 14th to mid 18th centuries. It was during this period that distinct Ruthenian and then Ukrainian languages developed from the Old East Slavic language.  While the Russian empire did gain control of Kiev and some areas East of the Dneiper River in the mid 17th century, most of present day Ukraine wasn't conquered by the Russian Empire until the reign of Catherine the Great in the late 18th century.\n\nThen, after Ukrainians fought for and gained independence in 1917, the Ukrainian People's Republic eventually became the Ukrainian SSR, which became one of the founding member states of the UN in 1945. This is similar to Belarus. Even as part of the USSR, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova were all distinct SSRs. Would you say that these were all part of Russia?",

Many of the Native American nations moved around lots not so long before the actual creation of America. Maoris are considered indigenous in New Zealand. Have a [look at the arrival times for their people on a map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_people#/media/File:First_human_migration_to_New_Zealand.svg) and you will see its even 14th century. What's important is that, when the world became all connected, from the 17th to 20th Century, New Zealand, and nowhere else was the origin and center of Maori culture.\n\nHowever, Arab / Muslim culture can never be indigenous in Palestine for different reasons. Arab culture in Palestine maintains it's active links with the original locations of Arab culture centered around Mecca (and also other locations such as Medina - like Jewish culture, because Arab culture is intertwined with Islam it's a complex discussion and you might also take it back to all of the nomadic Arab tribes beforehand). Although the original conquest of Palestine was in the 7th century there were ongoing conquests - importantly for this, the Mamelukes returned Arab culture to the area in the 12th century and the Ottomans in the 16th renewed the Muslim nature of the culture. \n\nMost importantly Palestinian Arabs do not recognize any indigenous Canaanite religions. Some Palestinians have a proportion Canaanite genetics, often from conquered Jews who were forcibly converted and enslaved or just simply joined into Arab culture, abandoning their indigenous culture. Palestinians generally however do not maintain any Canaanite culture and they do not maintain links with that history. \n\nWhat's key in the end is that, whilst Judaism and Jewishness are parts of Canaanite originated culture, native to the area of Judea, Arabism is an import that came together with conquest and inherently not indigenous to the area. \n\nThe real question, though, is what does it matter. What difference if someone arrived in the 16th century or the 19th? For culture it's that Judaism is a representation of a historical culture which has a unique origin in the region. Declaring indignity is meant as an important part of ensuring that historical knowledge and understanding is maintained. However, for two people born in a place, to legal residents of that place, whether of indigenous or colonial cultures they both should be allowed to stay in the place of their birth.",

In other words, it was the willingness of the Palestinians to bet the farm on violent conflict as a way to push the Jews out that resulted in their permanent exile. The Israelis don't want those people inside Israel. They don't want them as neighbors, especially since they've continued on with violent action. Those Arabs who remained right where they were were allowed to stay and, today, are citizens of the state of Israel.

The civil war of 1947, and the Arab invasion of 1948, were intended to push the Jews out. The Arabs were tired of all these Jews showing up in Palestine, buying land, and making themselves a pain in the ass by dominating industry, developing land, and basically creating prosperity and pushing for their own country. \n\nI can understand why the Arabs were somewhat annoyed, as it completely disrupted their traditional way a life. But that's no excuse to start a violent terror campaign and an open conflict targeting men, women and children. They bet the farm that violence would succeed. It didn't succeed. The Jews won and the Palestinians and the Arab nations supporting them lost. It's kind of understandable that, after the war, the Israelis wouldn't want the Palestinians back. They didn't trust them. They didn't want them as friends, as colleagues, or as neighbors. I get that completely. Why would you invite a group of people to return who'd just tried to get rid of you?\n\nThe Coles Notes version of what I'm saying is this: if the Arabs hadn't turned to violence, they'd probably be living inside Israel to this day.

    "body": "You make a fair point that human history is full of migration but claiming the word \"Indigenous\" has no valid meaning is historically and legally incorrect. In international law and sociology, being Indigenous isn't just about who biologically stepped on a piece of land first. It is defined by the relationship between a people and a dominant power. It specifically refers to communities that existed before colonial invasion or conquest and who maintain distinct cultural and political systems separate from the dominant society.\n\nYour argument about everyone being from Africa relies on a logical fallacy. While the human species biologically originated in Africa, \"Indigeneity\" refers to where a specific culture and people group emerged. Afrikaners arrived with an established Dutch culture and imposed it; they did not develop as a distinct people group from the land in the same way the Khoisan did. That is the key difference.\n\nRegarding the English or Finns, they generally aren't part of the \"Indigenous\" conversation because they hold the power in their own lands. The term is most useful when describing marginalised groups fighting to preserve their pre-colonial identity. So, while you are right that ancient history shouldn't necessarily grant modern real estate rights, the term itself describes a very real political status that protects groups from being wiped out by colonisation.",

That context matters.\n\nA useful analogy is this:\nIf a family buys land, builds a home, raises generations there, buries their dead there, and organizes their lives around that land... centuries later an armed outsider arrives, redraws the property lines, declares legal ownership, and enforces it with violence.

    "body": "i don't really like the word \"indigenous\", especially in the context of the middle east, where borders have shifted repeatedly and dramatically over thousands of years. the region has seen many populations arrive, settle, mix, and leave, which gradually reshaped genetics, cultures, and languages. some languages went extinct, others were revived after centuries of disuse, some languages remained but are only spoken by a handful of people. even the concept of \"indigenous\" itself is not fixed. it is a *working definition* developed by the UN. the definition is usually selectively applied by people to support a particular political narrative.\n\n1. some people define indigeneity primarily by genetics. a higher percentage of DNA tied to a particular land. under this definition of indigeneity, technically samaritans and palestinian christians would be the most indigeneous, since they are among the least genetically mixed groups in the region and show the strongest continuity with bronze age canaanite populations. more so than most jewish or levantine muslim populations.\n2. others argue that DNA is less important than language and cultural continuity. from that perspective, israeli jews are considered the most indigeneous, because they speak modern hebrew, which is mostly a canaanite language. hebrew speakers can often understand other canaanite languages more easily than most arabic speakers.\n\nyet both of these definitions have flaws. for example, egyptian copts primarily speak arabic today, and most cannot hold a fluent convo in coptic. however, egyptian copts are basically walking ancient egyptians genetically and historically who adopted christianity and then arabic.\n\nsimilarly israeli jews are diverse. there are ashkenazi jews, ethiopian jews, yemenite jews, and other jewish gorups that have varying degrees of non-levantine genetic mixture. they have genetic ties to the land, but those genetic ties are not as strong as samaritans and palestinian christians. at the same time, israeli jews revived hebrew language that predates the widespread rise of arabic into the region.\n\nso given this i think its better to simply say \"jews and palestinians have a connection to the land\". and then whatever comes after this is just political narratives not facts.\n\nedit: 3. and then there's the argument that indigeneity is defined primarily by having been colonized (which is basically the UN working definition).",

In the Americas, in contrast to the Levant, the Native American \"First Peoples,\" indigenous to that part of the world, only arrived there 20 or 30k years ago and created civilizations that had no contact with the rest of the world until the late 15th and early 16th centuries.\n\nHominids have been living in the Levant, however, for well over a million years, long before the existence of Homo sapiens, the modern human species. All humans who left Africa, including the Native Americans' ancestors, passed through the Levant to populate the rest of the world.\n\nThe indigeneity argument, although significant when discussing Spanish, Portuguese, French, and English colonialism in the Americas, is meaningless in the Levant and part of a concerted campaign that Adam Louis-Klein, in particular, has discussed in detail. His recent essay on Substack is really brief and concludes with this paragraph:\n\n\"...Western antizionism is far more inward-looking, guilt-ridden, and self-critical in form. Here, Jews are not only treated as external enemies but as reflections of the Western self. Israel becomes the screen onto which the West projects its historical sins—colonialism, racism, genocide—transforming Jewish survival and return into a symbol of Western failure. In this mode, Israel comes to represent the foundations of Western civilization itself, and Jews are condemned not necessarily for being Other, but for appearing as a distorted image of the West’s own crimes.\"\n\n\"Guilt ridden antizionism\" from\n***Soviet Antizionism, Western Antizionism by Adam Louis-Klein on Substack***\n\nhttps://open.substack.com/pub/conformal/p/soviet-antizionism-western-antizionism?r=7pici&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;shareImageVariant=overlay",

To me, it is defined more as the relationship between one group of people and another more dominant group within society. There is more to it than this, but this is how I view it. The UN has a webpage that is more specific. But this is how I generally think of it.\n\nYou may be surprised to know that there are groups who are considered indigenous who either did not come to the land first, or we are not sure if they did. The Sami are an example of this. Ultimately, we care about the indigenous label because of the implantation of their place in broader society. Though indigenous is still a label.

And I can get why their inhabitans have zero interest in becoming Argentinians since we aren't the posters of a sane nation either.\n\nBy the end it makes little sense if the Arabs at some point conquered it, they not only got Jordan, its biggest chunk for the mandate but, on top of it, they lost war after war, in any other conflict they might have been absorbed already and the rest kicked out without anyone being any wiser. But no, we keep forcing the status quo to remain and more wars will happen, the right to be there does not mean anything after you lost that many times in a row.\n\nThey had the chance, a real one, of state-building after 2005 and they squandered it, I doubt that will repeat themselves and they are the only ones to blame for that.",

I understand where that fear comes from. Many Palestinians reject the legitimacy of an Israeli state and call for its downfall or destruction. That makes people feel like Palestinians, if free, would pose an existential threat to Israeli Jews and essentially wipe them out. I get that fear. Especially after the Hamas massacres on October 7th and the rhetoric that they would do it again if they had the chance, as well as the imagery of Palestinians and those who stand in solidarity with them celebrating the atrocities as a victory against Israel. As well as the waves of terrorist attacks targeting Israeli civilians, escalating around moments like the second Intifada which are often framed by supporters of Palestine as important moments in the struggle for Palestinian freedom. I understand that fear.\n\nThat said, if you saw the way Palestinians were subjugated, the lines of elderly queueing for an hour or more at the Qalandiya checkpoint with metal turnstiles suddenly slamming shut in their face as they hurry on their commute into occupied East Jerusalem and to their ultimate destination to work in Israel, the ever-receding boundaries of villages as settlements and \"firing zones\" go up in the South Hebron Hills and elsewhere and are accompanied by a military presence, the arrest of young people including children, students, and activists accused of incitement or assaulting soldiers (occupying forces), the demolition of family homes due to the crimes of one family member, the loss of a never-ending tally of innocents as casualties in weekly Israeli military raids targeting militant groups (which use terror against civilians) in major cities with perceived impunity, the inability to enter or leave parts of the country due to the maze of settlements and the Israeli military police even to enter neighboring Jordan from the West Bank... if you saw the majority of Gazan homes destroyed and the majority of the West Bank swallowed by settlements, you would understand why to many Palestinians, the state of Israel is inseparable from the settlers at their doorstep, it's embodied by the soldiers in their cities, it's an endorsement of their displacement and dispossession. To you, Israel may be much more than that and much of that is an act of self-defense or the actions of the fringe of Israeli society. It's a safehaven for Jews persecuted around the world, a pocket of democracy, etc. But to Palestinians, it's the greatest thing standing between them and freedom.",

You've encouraged me to do some research on the following so I can have a more informed opinion on a) the history of negotiations between the leadership of the two nations and b) the shift in Palestinian and Israeli public opinion over time. In the meantime, can you point to examples of offers made to the Palestinians that you view as both morally acceptable and provide a clear pathway to Palestinian sovereignty within internationally recognized borders? I'm admittedly not familiar enough with the negotiations to point to one quite yet. Starting with the 1947 UN partition plan, which offered Palestinians a state on 44.5 percent of the land where they constituted 66 percent of the population following decades of mass Jewish migration under British rule, I can understand why Palestinians rejected the offer. They had been denied self-determination by the British following WWI, who instead executed a policy of population transfer resulting in demographic upheaval against the will of the locals, all with the stated goal of establishing a settler colony, followed by a Jewish state on a land where––at the time of the Balfour delcaration which committed Britain to establishing a Jewish state––Jews made up a population of 60,000, less than 10 percent of the population. The Palestinian demand for self-determination in the land which they made up an overwhelming majority if not for settlement under colonial rule does not strike me as maximalist and their reaction to the imposition of this policy with violence during the 1936-1939 Arab revolt or in 1947 does not seem morally wrong––even if they lacked the military power to achieve their aims. \n\nFeel free to point me to resources that challenge the underlying moral framework I'm using to understand the issue––that is, settler colonialism and population change at the expense of a subjugated population, culminating in a partition which denied them self-determination in the majority of their homeland. I acknowledge the Palestinian portion of the land was more fertile.\n\nI don't disagree with the notion that Palestinians have made repeated strategic failures in the face of an opponent which often wielded superior military force and eventually greater international support. There are concessions which would have served their long-term interest in survival. But can you point to specific examples of where mainstream Palestinian demands were maximalist?",

That doesn't mean they would have been morally justified in denying blacks self-determination and equal rights. Legitimate fear is not a carte blanche to deny others their rights.

For many people it also includes the Right of Return for Palestinian refugees who were displaced in 1948 and 1967. At its core, the idea is that Palestinians should have the same right to self determination and the same basic human rights that Israelis currently have.\n\nIn response to your points about social justice, a counter argument is that extremism often grows in situations of hopelessness, violence, and long term occupation. Iit is very hard to build a progressive society or properly protect vulnerable communities when people are mainly worried about survival under military control. While you noted that Israel does not have an official state religion, critics often point out that the “Nation State Law” clearly defines Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people, which in practice creates different levels of citizenship and pushes non-Jewish citizens to the margins.\n\nWhen it comes to ideas about the future, the most hopeful vision, outside of a two state solution, is one shared, secular, democratic state. In this model, everyone living between the river and the sea, no matter their religion or ethnic background, would have equal voting rights and the same legal protections. This could reduce the demographic fears you mentioned and shift the focus toward equal rights for all.

Nation State Law 2018 only pertains to Jews and mentions Arabic in literally some parts of the law so unless you're comparing Jews to Arabic there is no comparison grounds and if you're comparing Hebrew to Arabic then languages don't have inequalities. So no, there is no inequality present in that law. \n\nSecond one is also incorrect as well because the self-determination rights while having been extended to Jews is because they are indigenous to Israel and as such this caters to and is primarily centered around the indigenous rights of Jewish people. It literally says nothing about non-Jewish citizens so your thing doesn't even exist in the law. Not to mention, self-determination rights centered around indigenity for one group doesn't impact national rights of other groups at all. Australia has Australian nationals and yet they also have [Native Title Act 1993 (clth)](https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdb/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1993147/) (**the best analog and contextual comparison of Nation State Law 2018 (Israel)**,) which confers self determination rights and recognizes the indigenity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people or ATSI Australians so Australians still have Australia as their national home but it is only ATSI Australians that have self determination per indigenous rights. \n\nIncorrect again on the 3rd one, it doesn't mention a disadvantage for other groups it only promotes Jewish settlement so the disadvantage doesn't actually exist in the law. \n\nJust flat out wrong again on this one, by saying special status is lower you are  assuming a difference between special and official when there is nothing in the law indicating that in fact section 4c specifically says *\"Nothing in this article shall compromise the status given to the Arabic language in practice, before this basic-law came into force.\"*, nothing shall compromise is the exact opposite of lower, lower means compromising the status so no there is no lowering of the language. 2nd part of this one is also incorrect, *\"Hebrew is the language of the state\"* is what they say, they never use the word only so Hebrew is in fact not the only language of the state. There is literally no only there. \n\nThe only things you manage to be correct about here is that they don't remove basic civil rights like voting and that the state belongs to one group but the rest of it literally has no basis in the law itself.",

    "body": "The key tool Israel uses to implement the principle of Jewish supremacy is engineering space geographically, demographically and politically. Jews go about their lives in a single, contiguous space where they enjoy full rights and self-determination. In contrast, Palestinians live in a space that is fragmented into several units, each with a different set of rights – given or denied by Israel, but always inferior to the rights accorded to Jews.\n\nThe Israeli regime pursues this organizing principle in four major areas:\n\nLand – Israel works to Judaize the entire area, treating land as a resource chiefly meant to benefit the Jewish population. Since 1948, Israel has taken over 90% of the land within the Green Line and built hundreds of communities for the Jewish population. Since 1967, Israel has also enacted this policy in the West Bank, building more than 280 settlements for some 600,000 Jewish Israeli citizens. Israel has not built a single community for the Palestinian population in the entire area stretching from the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River (with the exception of several communities built to concentrate the Bedouin population after dispossessing them of most of their property rights).\n \nCitizenship – Jews living anywhere in the world, their children and grandchildren – and their spouses – are entitled to Israeli citizenship. In contrast, Palestinians cannot immigrate to Israeli-controlled areas, even if they, their parents or their grandparents were born and lived there. Israel makes it difficult for Palestinians who live in one of the units it controls to obtain status in another, and has enacted legislation that prohibits granting Palestinians who marry Israelis status within the Green Line.\n \nFreedom of movement – Israeli citizens enjoy freedom of movement in the entire area controlled by Israel (with the exception of the Gaza Strip) and may enter and leave the country freely. Palestinian subjects, on the other hand, require a special Israeli-issued permit to travel between the units (and sometimes inside them), and exit abroad also requires Israeli approval.\n \nPolitical participation – Palestinian citizens of Israel may vote and run for office, but leading politicians consistently undermine the legitimacy of Palestinian political representatives. The roughly five million Palestinians who live in the Occupied Territories, including East Jerusalem, cannot participate in the political system that governs their lives and determines their future. They are denied other political rights as well, including freedom of speech and association.\n\nSOURCE: https://www.btselem.org/apartheid",

The idea that the antichrist is primarily openly anti-Christian and overtly violent is a popular culture caricature, not what the texts actually emphasize. In the New Testament, especially the Johannine letters, and Revelation, the defining feature is deception; appearing righteous, sounding moral, and leading people astray while claiming legitimacy. The “lamb-like” appearance paired with a “dragon’s voice” is the opposite of open villainy.\nMore importantly, the leap from a state level symbolic critique to “Jews now have to prove they aren’t the antichrist” is either careless or deliberately misleading. The post explicitly distinguishes between a state apparatus and Jewish people or Judaism. Collapsing those categories is not exposing antisemitism; it’s committing the very conflation the post goes out of its way to reject.\n\nLabeling any critique of a state’s behavior as “classical antisemitism” doesn’t refute the argument; it functions as a rhetorical shield. Ironically, that move mirrors the exact dynamic being analyzed, reframing criticism as heresy so the substance never has to be addressed.

It’s defined by contradiction, claiming moral righteousness while acting in direct opposition to the values it invokes (justice, mercy, restraint, and protection of the innocent), while demanding loyalty and suppressing dissent. \n\nSorry what.  The [Christian] bible directly uses the term four places:\n\n1. 1 John 2:22 -- Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the **antichrist**—denying the Father and the Son. [defines earlier use in 1Jn2:18]. \n\n2. 1 John 4:8 -- but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the **antichrist**, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.\n\n2. 2 John 1:7 -- I say this because many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the **antichrist**.\n\nBut generally in modern theology it gets tied to other prophecies of the end of the world the false prophet a king: *“And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. And it had two horns like a lamb, but spoke like a dragon. And _it executes all the authority of the first beast before it. And it causes that the earth and those dwelling in it should worship the first beast, of which was healed its deadly wound. And it does great signs, that it even causes fire to come down out of the heaven onto the earth before men. And it deceives those dwelling on the earth, because of the signs which were given to it to do before the beast* (Rev 13:11-14). \n\nThere is no hint of relativism or non-hypocrisy as the defining characteristic.  \n\n&gt; , the modern Israeli state increasingly operates as a system that places itself above accountability.\n\nFWIW this is also false.  Israel wants to be held accountable under the same rules as other states are.  The problem Israel has had it is that at least rhetorically it gets treated extremely unfairly.  https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/s658yw/yes_the_un_does_discriminate_and_incite_against/",

States are collections of individuals operating inside incentives, hierarchies, and ideologies. When scripture talks about “any person” or the “spirit of the antichrist” already at work, it’s explicitly acknowledging that individuals can embody and transmit that spirit through institutions, not just as lone villains. A system doesn’t deny truth by itself, people do, repeatedly, in coordinated ways, until that denial becomes policy.\n\nFurthermore, you’re responding to an argument I didn’t make. I wasn’t claiming Israel is a literal end times individual who verbally denies Christ, so listing prooftexts about doctrinal denial doesn’t actually engage what I wrote. I was explicit that this is a symbolic and systemic use of the antichrist / false prophet framework, which is neither novel nor fringe in Christian or political theology.\n\nIronically, the verses you cite, especially 1 John 4:3—undercut your own point by introducing the “spirit of the antichrist” as something already active in the world. That language is about patterns and forces, not just a single person. Revelation’s false prophet functions the same way: legitimizing power, enforcing loyalty, suppressing dissent, and sanctifying authority. Those are institutional roles.\n\nThat’s the lens being applied here. The argument stands on observable behavior, moral absolutism, exemption from law, reframing criticism as hostility, and demanding loyalty over accountability. If your objection depends on collapsing “antichrist” into a narrow, literal checklist while ignoring how the concept actually functions, then you’re not refuting the argument, you’re avoiding it.",

Christian nationalism clearly influences U.S. foreign policy in practice, regardless of whether it’s formally codified as a state religion.\n\nThe same applies to Israel. Whether or not it declares an official religion is beside the point. States don’t need formal theocracy to sacralize themselves. When identity, historical trauma, and moral exceptionalism are embedded into law, policy, and justification for force, religion is already operating as political insulation. That’s what’s being analyzed here; how authority shields itself from accountability, not whether a legal definition checks a particular box.\n\nAs for redirecting this argument toward Islamic theocracies... that critique already exists, widely and without controversy. Applying the same analytical framework here isn’t inconsistency, it’s intellectual honesty. Pointing to other examples doesn’t invalidate this one; it confirms that the lens is being applied evenly.

I would say even a holocaust of 20 million African people who had done nothing to the Islamic empires yet were killed in cold blood...\n\nI don't feel all Palestinians are terrorists but obviously some are. \n\nJews were oppressed and horrifically mistreated for countless centuries by the Palestinians and other Arabs and Turks.... One example of this is the pogroms of 1834 and 1838 in what is now Israel. Honestly if Jews were not such humanitarians they would probably have done what we as Africans did in Zanzibar... Where in an act of \"intifada\" we killed thousands of Arab Muslims if not tens of thousands and forcibly expelled the Arab population from our country of Zanzibar.\n\nI disagree with ALL forms of \"intifada\" which is mass murder of innocent people.

This claim is not catered for a Jewish state; I oppose any state that aims for its entire population to be that of a single racial or religious group: Afghanistan, Iran, China, Pakistan, Egypt, etc.\n\nNo one claims it should exist just for Jews. It actually has more Muslims than any non-majority Muslim country. There are many people that have their own country not just the Jewish people. Palestinians want their own country, Kurds, etc. And as you said many people actually do have their own country. The Jews needed their own country even more because no other country in the region would tolerate the Jews.\n\n&gt;2. All Palestinians are terrorists who want to kill the Jews.\n\n&gt;make such a broad-sweeping claim is disingenuous to the issue at hand. Of course, there are some Palestinians who want to eradicate all the Jews, just as there are some Israelis who want to eradicate all the Palestinians (I say some, but in a conflict as large and ongoing as this, it's likely that \"most\" could be applied to both parties). But to say \"all\" feels like an attempt by those in power to sway the opinion of the people.\n\nNo one is saying all Palestinians want to kill Jews. Its the policy of the government. The Palestinians setup pay to slay laws, elect a government that actively engages in terrorist attacks against Jews, and teaches killing Jews in their schools. Israel actually prosecutes people for committing terror, and the family of people like Baruch Goldstein receive nothing.\n\n&gt;3. Palestinians started this conflict.\n\n&gt;The conflict started in 1917 when England established \"in Palestine... a national home for the Jewish people\" (Balfour Declaration, 1917) and was furthered in 1948 when Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion said, \"We must expel Arabs and take their places…and, if we have to use force...then we have force at our disposal.\" (Nur Masahla, Expulsion of the Palestinians, p. 66) During which, over 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from British-controlled Mandatory Palestine. Since then, Palestine's borders and population have been shrinking.\n\nI'm actually not familiar with that quote, but the Zionist completely expected Arabs to live with them in Israel, as the do today with more Arabs as a percentage than any non-Muslim nation. At the founding of Israel they were attacked on day one by the Arabs.\n\n&gt;4. This is the price of war.\n\n&gt;From October 7, 2023–November 19, 2025 Israel has endured 1,654 fatalities and 8,295 injuries while Palestine has endured 61,158 fatalities and 151,442 injuries (Statista, 2025). This hardly feels justifiable. I'd be more inclined to agree if the numbers were similar, but Palestine has experience nearly 21x more damage than Israel. It feels like indiscriminate killing. Not to mention that Gaza has been flattened and now the Palestinians are living in tents because their homes are unlivable.\n\nThe rules of proportionality applies to each military operations, which Israel considers on every operation. Palestine could have ended this war at any time by returning the hostages and removing Hamas from power. A similar request to the German after WW2. It's also important to note that Israelis have always put more values of the life of their citizens than Palestinians. Including trading over 1,000 Palestinians for 1 Israelis.",

One can make numerous arguments about the injustices done to their ancestors and go back and forth. But, that does not define the injustices of the current situation. What does a Palestinian farmhand in 1920 have to do with European Jews migrating over to seek restitution, whatever that means? It is true that the Zionist Movement sought land purchases, immigration, militarization with one possible goal of evicting Palestinians to have sufficient Jewish majority for a Jewish state. Leaders like Ben Gurion and Chaim Weizmann recognized this and lobbied for this (Paris Conference, Biltmore Conference etc.) The Jewish Militias *organized* in a massive scale and began sectarian violence in anticipation of the British Withdrawal (Village files project, Plan Dalet, Coastal clearing operations of 1948).\n4. This is not a complaint about Israel's strength. But one about the inhumanely disproportionate response. More than 70,000 documented dead.

Jewish immigration to the region started in the late 19th century, well before Balfour. Of course, they faced violence from local Arabs just like they had for a thousand+ years, because the Arabic Islamic world is both racially and religiously intolerant.

Who says that Israel is aiming for 100% Jews in the country? If it were aiming for such, why would they have given citizenship to all of the Arabs and Christians who stayed after the state was established and value them as citizens? I'm not arguing some of the laws need change and updating, but to posit what you did is patently false and cannot be proven accurate at all. The US is a nation built on Christianity and is still extremely Christian-centric, even classifying Christian holidays as 'federal' holidays. Does that mean the US aims to be a 100% Christian country? Do you seek to abolish the US borders entirely?\n2. I really don't think many informed people think this at all. Maybe some far-right wingers but most are pretty logical and reasonable about this.\n3. You have included a very selective telling of history. The conflict didn’t suddenly start in 1917.For centuries under the Ottoman Empire, there was never one unified “Palestinian Arab state.” Arab towns, tribes, and villages mostly governed themselves and lived independently of one another, and tensions already existed between them. Early Jewish communities legally bought land from Arab and Ottoman owners and lived on those plots. They weren’t taking over a single, cohesive Arab homeland they were settling on specific pieces of land they had purchased, alongside other independent communities. The Balfour Declaration also said the rights of Arabs *must* be protected. The Ben-Gurion quote is heavily disputed and doesn’t reflect any official policy. In 1948, the refugee crisis happened during a full regional war *after* Arab states rejected partition, some Palestinians fled, some were pushed out, and millions of Jews were also expelled from Arab countries. And Palestinians haven’t “shrunk”, their population has grown; the borders remain disputed because of wars and failed peace efforts. The real history is far more complicated than your cherry picked version.\n4. First off, people called it a genocide on October 8th, 2023 before a single Gazan had died from this war. So it's really hard to take this claim seriously without feeling like you all were going to call it a genocide even if 0 deaths had occurred. Second, you’re saying you’d feel better if the numbers were “more even.” That’s not how war works at all. Wars are never balanced. In World War II, far more Germans and Japanese civilians died than Americans or British. In the Gulf War, Iraqi losses were massively higher than US losses. In Syria’s civil war, most casualties were Syrians, not their foreign backers. Lopsided numbers don’t make a war moral or immoral, they just show that one side has different tactics and capabilities Treating it like a scorecard makes no logical sense.\n\nIt's not a game where you pick a side because they have cool jerseys or your favorite player or are the underdog. These are real human people and both sides deserve peace and sovereignty, not at the expense of the other.",

Obviously it's not *all* Palestinians, but you do need to look at percentage, and even more important, your definitions. The 7/10 massacre was carried out by several thousand terrorists, which, out of 2.1 million people living in Gaza seems like a minority. However, a survey that was done very shortly after the massacre among ordinary people of Gaza has shown that 80% of those surveyed supported it, and most of the 20% who opposed it cited the expected Israeli retaliation as their main concern. So, if you include all of those who want to see all Jews killed in the category of \"want to kill all the Jews\", then that claim is shockingly accurate.\n3. The borders of \"Palestine\" have never shrunk because it never existed. Before 1948 it was all under the British mandate. There were several Jewish settlements and several Arab settlements but most of the land was empty, with neither side having any stronger claim to it than the other. Then the Arabs rejected the 1947 UN partition plan and started the 1948 war, and lost. Between 1948 and 1967 the Gaza strip was occupied by Egypt and the West Bank was occupied by Jordan. It was never free nor independent. The first time Palestinians got any kind of self governance (even if partial) was in 1993, following the Oslo accords. And regarding the population - there are a lot more Palestinians living in Gaza and the West Bank today than there were in 1948, by orders of magnitude.\n4. The fact that one side is inferior in military strength does not automatically make it the righteous side. Real life isn't an anime or fantasy novel. War is nasty and people get killed; that's just how it is. You can't expect one side to endanger their own lives just to reduce the number of casualties on the enemy side. And by the way, that number you've mentioned has no proper backing other than the \"Gaza ministry of health\", which is controlled by Hamas. It's very likely to be artificially inflated (e.g. by including natural deaths) and even if it's accurate, Hamas' reports don't tell civilians and combatants apart. You don't know how many of those 61k presumably killed were actually Hamas terrorists, and I suspect it was well over 50%.",

I am *not* saying that \"Israel has no right to exist,\" but that Israel as a country established strictly for Jewish people has no right to exist. This claim is not catered for a Jewish state; I oppose any state that aims for its entire population to be that of a single racial or religious group: Afghanistan, Iran, China, Pakistan, Egypt, etc.\n\nIsrael does not strive to have all its citizens be Jewish. It always had a minority majority of Arabs, now about 20% of the population, and a variety of other, smaller ethnic groups. What Israel strives towards is maintaining a Jewish **majority**. It may seem like a nitpick or semantics, but there is a very big difference between the two. The reason behind this is that Jews, as a people, do not believe that it is possible for them to be a minority group, especially in the Middle East, without being subject to persecution.  \n\n&gt;All Palestinians are terrorists who want to kill the Jews.\n\nI think this is a disgusting statement, and I do not consider any Israeli who holds this opinion a person worth listening to. I dont think it is representative of what the majority of Israelis think, either. \n\n&gt;The conflict started in 1917 when England established \"in Palestine... a national home for the Jewish people\" (Balfour Declaration, 1917) and was furthered in 1948 when Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion said, \"We must expel Arabs and take their places…and, if we have to use force...then we have force at our disposal.\" (Nur Masahla, Expulsion of the Palestinians, p. 66) During which, over 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from British-controlled Mandatory Palestine. Since then, Palestine's borders and population have been shrinking.\n\nThe idea of even trying to ask \"who started it\" is a little silly to me. The problem here is that both peoples started it. Both Arabs and Jews had understandable reasons to fight each other in 1947. Jews had nowhere else to go, and refused to be a minority again, not after the Holocaust. Arab Palestinians lived in the land for generations, and did not want to leave it for other people, who were essentially foreigners. We can spend hours pointing into different events and saying \"this side started it!\" and we will always be right. Because they both did. Some conflicts happen for understandable reasons. \n\n&gt;This is the price of war.\n\nA half-truth. On one hand, this is a true statement. Hamas **did** start this war. Hamas **does** use tactics that endanger the civilian population of Gaza. Urban combat **is** notorious for the damage it causes, no matter how careful the participating actors are. On the other hand, Israel **does** have lucklaster targeting standards, **does** commit warcrimes, and **does** show a lack of care for the civilian population of Gaza. All of those things are true at the same time. So the \"price of war\" argument, simply put, does not work in all instances, it is not applicable for every situation. It is a surface-level observation that doesn't involve much thinking, after all, so it is expected.",

But this is the exact kind of nonsensical back and forths I'm talking about.\n\nI think you're being a little disingenuous although I appreciate that you've already acknowledged that Palestinians lived on the land for generations and didn't like it being taken from them.\n\nWorking out who started it is not nonsensical and in fact it's quite simple: to resist something (as you stated) implies that there is a thing happening first which subsequently undergoes resistance. Anyway the question under discussion here is \"who started it\" in modern history b/w Zionists and Palestinians, it's not about whether each side had understandable reasons for actions they took.\n\n\\&gt;And all actions of the Zionists were a reaction to European antisemitism, which included the Balfour declaration, btw. \n\nOK, so now you are agreeing with OP that the Balfour declaration started the current situation between Zionists and Palestinians :)? And sure you can say that Herzl's Zionism was partly a reaction to European antisemitism, but what does that have to do with Palestinians? Let's be reductive: *European antisemitism -&gt; Zionism  -&gt; Mass migration to Palestine to create Jewish-majority state incl. displacement of existing population*. Which action starts the conflict **specifically** between Zionists and Palestinians?\n\nNow again, the reason why it's important to make this distinction of \"who started it\" is that it informs justice and restitution.\n\n\\&gt;Let's see if you are able to see the other side in good faith, because I'm very much able to do this for the Palestinian-Arabs. If you were a European Jew in the 1920s-1930s, what would you do? What would you feel? What would you support?\n\nWho knows? Yes I very well understand the justifications Zionists used, doesn't change the facts of what they did though. And at any rate what I hypothetically think I would do is irrelevant to the question of who started it, and it's like me asking - \"If you were a non-Jew German in the 1930s and 1940s, what would you do?\" It doesn't change the facts that they committed and/or were complicit in atrocities, regardless of whatever reasons they had. When you commit war crimes, they're still war crimes even if you had 'reasons' to commit them",

    "body": "Wow! A good faith pro-palestine person. That feels quite rare. I'll be happy to engage if that's the case. Alright, let's cover this point by point:\n\n1)\n&gt; I don't believe an ethno-religious-state has a right to exist. I oppose any state that aims for its entire population to be that of a single racial or religious group\n\nIf this is a value that you hold, that's fine to have. However, I must point out 2 things here. The first is that you don't agree with ethno-religious states, but simultaneously are supporting the free palestine cause whose end goal is basically an ethno-religious state. That's a contradiction. The other thing is that Israel has never aimed for its entire population to be jewish. If that were true, then Israel's founding prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, wouldn't have offered citizenship to the arabs that stayed within Israel's armistice lines during its founding and declaration of independence in 1948.\n\n2)\n&gt; All Palestinians are terrorists who want to kill the Jews.\n\nThis is hyperbolic language used by very few people in the real world.\n\n3)\n&gt; Palestinians started this conflict. The conflict started in 1917 when England established \"in Palestine...a national home for the Jewish people\" (Balfour Declaration, 1917) and was furthered in 1948...\n\nPalestinian arab muslims DID start the conflict. This one is true. There's something disturbing about your point #3 and it's the fact that you started at 1917 and then skipped all the way to 1948. There's a gigantic omission of history there. There's a lot of important context and history in that 31 years in between. What that tells me, is that wherever you learned what you know about this conflict, that source was very selective about what history to share with you. No offense to you, but I find it to be incredibly common for pro-palestine people to only mention the history that's convenient for the palestine narrative.\nSo anyway, 1917 is a great place to start, but I would personally not consider it the start of the conflict. The Balfour Declaration was not official policy at that point in time, but rather it was a statement of intent by the Brits of what kind of future the area would have; That a portion of the mandate of palestine would be carved to make a jewish state. There was also an intention to carve an arab state for the hashemites, which became Jordan. Plus, the Balfour Declaration was explicitly clear that the intended jewish state wouldn't be only for jews. \n\n\"His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.\"\n\nIn my personal opinion, I would consider the start of the conflict to be where the first violence is located. So, who committed the first acts of aggression? This happened in 1920. In 1920, there were several massacres of jewish villages by mobs of arab muslims, including ancient jewish villages where jews have always lived. There were more massacres in 1921 and 1929 as well. And jews at this point hadn't stolen any land. They moved there legally and bought land. The jews responded to these massacres by forming militias to defend themselves from the pogroms. Some of these fighters go on to launch attacks on the muslims in the 30s and the conflict goes back and forth endlessly ever since then. THAT'S the real story and to this day, I've never heard even one pro-palestine person ever acknowledge the 20s. They always seem to just focus on the nakba.\n\n4)\n&gt; This is the price of war. From October 7, 2023--November 19, 2025 Israel has endured 1,654 fatalities and 8,295 injuries while Palestine has endured 61,158 fatalities and 151,442 injuries (Statista, 2025). This hardly feels justifiable.\n\n\"This hardly feels justifiable.\" This is a huge difference of worldview. Hamas doesn't have the moral high ground just because they're weaker and have more losses. War is not a game where both sides must have equal losses in order for it to be fair and just. Factions at war seek to be as strong as possible and minimize their losses as much as possible, not to be equal. The whole point is to win, ideally, as overwhelmingly as possible. Somewhere around almost half of those casulties are hamas militants and the majority of the rest are civilian casualties mainly on hamas' hands. It's not just due to their human sacrifice strategy; They have also sniped and shot down many of their own people throughout the war.",

    "body": "Okay, so, you're either being intentionally disingenuous or you've been fed a bullshit one-sided narrative and believe in it. You're taking the late 1800s land purchases and overly-simplifying them to merely being evictions. I can't imagine a more one-sided way to describe it than what you put. Furthermore, you're attributing this to being the primary reason for the start of the violence, which is also incorrect. You're attempting to provide context for violence and yet are only mentioning selective details while omitting crucial context on those details. Isn't that hypocritical in a way? Wouldn't that be indicative of someone pushing a narrative instead of presenting a fuller history? What's particularly telling about your response is that the only thing you had to say about the 20s is a reference to al aqsa. That relates to 1929's Hebron massacre, which is the most famous of all the 20s massacres. Why would that be even an appropriate place for you start in this particular conversation about first violence when that one occurs 9 years after the first violence?\n\nHere's what you're missing ---&gt; Jews from Europe started immigrating to the area by working with Ottoman leaders to obtain permission to enter the district of palestine. Jewish leaders also negotiated with ottoman leadership to obtain land grants and to purchase land. Outside of the ottoman government, it was wealthy absentee landowners from Istanbul that were very open to selling land. While it's true that some evictions happened, most of these purchases did not result in evictions displacing arabs. The idea that arabs were mass evicted from palestine during this time is a distortion of history. Evictions DID happen, but only in a portion of the purchases. The actual on-the-ground reality is that these land purchases were NEAR arab communities, rather than replacing them. Jewish farming communities erected fences around their jewish-owned part of the land, which changed the way arab farmers grazed their flocks. As far as those minority of evictions go, I would say most of the blame goes to the ottomans rather than jews. Ottoman land magnates sent agents across the empire to make deals with random villagers. They offered these people to pay the empire's famously convoluted taxes for them in exchange for just signing a contract. Most farmers didn't realize they were trading away ownership for tax relief. Most arabs didn't ever realize, sometimes for generations, that they didn't actually own their land. When it comes to the evictions, it's understandable from the arab perspective, since they believed they owned their land and were now being told someone else owns it somehow. This would look like theft to them. It's also understandable from the jewish perspective, that they legally bought land the correct way, from the rightful owners, only to see that there are people there. It's unfortunate, but that's the reality. A lot more nuanced, don't you think?\n\nAs for the first violence, this occurs in early 1920 in an outpost called Tel Chai, not because of zionist immigration, but because mobs of arabs were resisting french occupation. Tel Chai is close to the Syrian border and the rioters perceived the jewish settlement as being part of the french mandate of syria, but the jews were adamantly also resisting the french. They considered themselves as being part of the british empire because they wanted to be part of the jewish state that the Brits had promised to grant. This could have all been avoided if the arabs had at least chose to talk and investigate first before going and killing a bunch of jews in a force of hundreds. Even the nearby shias thought this was crazy and tried to help the jews. This provides context for Bnei Yehuda. About a month later, in April, during a muslim festival, a jewish parade occurred aimed at the british where they demanded a jewish defense arm of the police to be made. They didn't wanted to be the victims of pogroms any longer, like what had happened just a month earlier in Tel Chai (now Kiryat Shemona). This resulted in yet another massacre. During these Nebi Musa riots, muslims attacked jewish homes &amp; synagogues, raped, wounded many people, and killed others, including children. The people there were chanting \"Palestine is our land and the jews are our dogs.\" Jews were not seen as equal human beings, but more like sub-human. That's the reality for all non-muslims that lived under dimmi subjugation in ottoman times and in countless other muslim held places in the world to this very day. The skeleton of the conflict is islamic intolerance. There may be things added on to it over time; flesh on top of the skeleton. However, the skeleton is the core. If you remove the core, the flesh will just flop to the ground. The identification of this core would be very debatable if it was just this incident as evidence, but when we consider all of the events that have taken place from here all the way to 2026, it's overwhelmingly clear that that's the true core issue.\n\nOne thing of interest that I'd like to add is that antisemitic literature was translated into arabic in 1920 and brought to palestine, including parts of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion garbage that the Soviets made. I don't know whose responsible for this importation, or for the translation, or how big of a difference this made in influencing the conflict, but I wouldn't be surprised if the impact was large. It may be that once again, the Soviets are to blame. They were also responsible for 1967, which would lead to the west bank situation that we have today.",

Sure, there are some more extreme Israelis that argue something like that, just like there's many pro-Palestinians who argue that all Israelis are illegitimate \"settlers\", if not outright murderers, rapists and \"genociders\". But obviously, this isn't some core \"pro-Israeli\" argument. You can be very pro-Israeli, like me, and not believe in it. \n\n&gt; and was furthered in 1948 when Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion said, \"We must expel Arabs and take their places…and, if we have to use force...then we have force at our disposal.\"\n\nThat one's simply a lie. Ben Gurion wrote the exact opposite, in his letter to his son (in 1936, not 1948): \"we *do not* want to expel the Arabs and take their place\". The error comes from ignoring part of the previous line that's scribbled out (\"we do not want and we do not\"), which mistakenly inverts the meaning of the sentence. But that mistake was already corrected by the early 2000's, so there's no justification to repeat it today. Furthermore, the rest of the context shows a complete opposite point - which you've dishonestly disguised with those elisions. The actual quote is (translated from the original Hebrew):\n\n&gt; We do not want and we do not need to expel Arabs and take their place, our aspiration is built on an assumption - that has been proven correct throughout our activity in the land - that there's enough room for us and the Arabs in the land, and if we need to use force - not in order to dispossess the Arabs of the Negev or\nTransjordan, but in order to guarantee our right to settle there - our force will allow us to do so.\n\nNow, if your inversion of the quote supposedly proves the pro-Palestinians are correct - would you concede that the fact it's fake, and says the complete opposite, proves the pro-Israelis correct? Or at the very least, make you start questioning a cause, that relies on such blatant forgeries? \n\n&gt; Since then, Palestine's borders and population have been shrinking.\n\nThe population of Palestine from the river to the sea is x5 of what it was in 1948. Even within Israel proper, where the 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from, it's nearly tripled, to over 2 million people. It didn't just not \"shrink\", it increased at one of the fastest rates in the world, far faster than Israel's own population. Again, you believe in something that's literally the opposite of reality.\n\nAs for the \"borders of Palestine shrinking\", I'm not even sure what you mean by those \"borders\". The British Mandate of Palestine was dissolved in 1948, so I guess you could argue its borders \"shrunk\" to nothing. From that point on, for forty years, no political entity called \"Palestine\" was formed, on any part of the land, including the parts occupied by the Arab states. But in 1988 the State of Palestine declared independence, and has mostly been gaining, not losing, land ever since. Whatever limited rule the Palestinians have in Gaza and Area A of the West Bank, is literally the most territory the Palestinian Arabs have ever ruled in history. The first time they  actually lost territory, rather than gaining it, is (potentially!) in this current war, and the current arrangement that splits Gaza in two. Finally, if by \"borders of Palestine\" you mean the geographic term of Palestine, according to which Israel is still \"occupied Palestine\" - they obviously never shrunk, or could shrink, even in theory. \n\nAgain, if that's the basis for your position, would that mean you'll reconsider it, once it's proven false?",

That means you support, even if you don't realize it, a far more exclusionary, ethnocratic and downright racist ethno-nationalist movement than Zionism ever was. And a country whose constitution and national charter defines its legitimate population as exclusively Arab (along with, possibly, a tiny, largely theoretical handful, of sufficiently \"Arab\", pre-Zionist Jews), and its laws based on the Islamic Shari'a. Where even the moderates insist that for Palestine to be \"free\", it has to be a racially pure Arab ethnostate, and roughly half a million Jews that live there must all be ethnically cleansed. Even the chant \"from the river to the sea\" in Arabic doesn't end with Palestine being \"free\", but with it being \"Arab\". And the flag they're waving, doesn't represent some kind of multiculturalism, but the flag of the Arab rebellion, representing the various invading Arab empires.\n\nOf course, you can still argue that what *you* believe in is something completely different... well, that means you're not \"pro-Palestinian\". You're pro something that Palestinians absolutely don't want, and goes against the core values of the Palestinian liberation movement. And if that's your schtick, you might as well argue you're *already* \"pro-Israeli\". After all, Israel, and the Zionist movement in general, is already far closer to the multi-cultural, civic nationalist ideals you hold, than anything the Palestinians have created, or want to create in the future. \n\n&gt; I oppose any state that aims for its entire population to be that of a single racial or religious group: Afghanistan, Iran, China, Pakistan, Egypt, etc.\n\nFirst of all, as I said, Israel, unlike Palestine, doesn't \"aim\" to be that at all. It always intended having a non-Jewish minority, from Herzl's Altneuland to the Israeli declaration of independence. It's population is 20% Palestinian Arab, a thousand times more than the number of Jews left in the Arab world, and the idea of expelling them is too extreme even for far-right politicians to express openly - if only because that would be grounds for barring them from the Knesset (as was the case with Kahane).\n\nSecond, of all the countries you mentioned, only the officially Arab Egypt is (sort of) an ethnic nation-state. The rest are various shades of oppressive and occasionally racist, but technically civic nation-states. You might argue that China is a de-facto ethnic nation-state, and a pretty racist one at that, but it's officially defined as a multicultural Communist state. Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, are not just officially, but also de-facto multi-ethnic states. With the Islamic Republic being more multicultural and non-Persian than liberal, secular Iranians that want to overthrow it, would want. They're theocratic, something Israel *isn't*, but they aren't officially defined as the national homeland of a specific ethnicity or ethnoreligious group. \n\nIf you actually want to bring equivalents to Israel, it would be something like Armenia, Latvia, Greece, and as I already mentioned, Palestine. Countries specifically created to be the expression of the inalienable Right of Self Determination of Peoples for a specific ethnic or national group. And I've yet to see a single pro-Palestinian oppose their existence. Even the most liberal civic nationalist Americans believe that replacing the officially civic nationalist Soviet Union with multiple ethnic nation-states, along with the more general concept of the Right of Self Determination, was an actively good thing - not even a neutral one.\n\nI think that, like many people who talk about this, you don't have a very clear idea of even what you're opposing or supporting. I've [written a post a while back, just for people like you](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1cqfdjl/ethnostates_ethnic_nationalism_and_israelpalestine/): ethnic vs. civic nationalism, \"ethnostate\" vs \"ethnocracy\" vs ethnic-nation-state, the Right of Self Determination of Peoples, etc.",

On the face of it, yes, they're a service provided to men only; but no, of course they aren't, it's disingenuous to decontextualise the existence of women's toilets too. There's a state earmarked for Jews -- on the face of it that's discriminatory, but only if you decontextualise the fact that there are other states where any other nation can thrive. In principle, Jews should be as content to be a minority in pluralist societies as say the Assyrians are here in Australia, but historically that hasn't always worked out.\n\n2.\n\nOf course not all are, not any newborn babies at a bare minimum. But a similar sentiment might be that if there are any peace-loving Gazans, they sure aren't making a lot of noise. For any given operation, only an idiot wouldn't assume any given passerby is likely to be hostile. You still shouldn't shoot without confirmation they're a threat, but you wouldn't let your guard down and you might do a compromise like pre-emptively arresting everyone and releasing them after.\n\n3.\n\nI don't think it's fair to characterise Balfour as an act of war, certainly not by the Jews since it was a British declaration, and if you like ancient history that much I don't think it's fair to skip over the Nebi Musa and Jaffa riots and the rest of the intercommunal conflict. But I don't think \"He started it\" is a great justification in general; I think \"He's still doing it *and refuses to de-escalate*\" is. We could debate whether any of Israel's peace offers were sincere or good enough, but my take is that they would be with some haggling, whereas I don't characterise any of Palestine's (PA's, Hamas's, PLO's) offers as being peace offers at all.\n\n4.\n\nHamas continued hostilities (in the form of holding hostages until recently, and now violating ceasefire lines); ought they have the right to do so? Why does your solution to the bloodshed not include \"They should stop doing so\"? Are they entitled to some minimum kill:death ratio? Do you think they would de-escalate if they had internationally-backed stop loss insurance? I'd agree that 60k is excessive for revenge, but clearly it isn't to neutralise Hamas: do you think revenge is a righteous goal but defending one's people is not? Yeah, 60k is an awful lot, but it's really hard to say war should have a price cap without causing serious problems.",

Ceding power to Arabs on 100% of the land would not be fair to native Jews. Ceding power to Jews on 100% of the land would not be fair to native Jews. They split it 85%-15%.

I personally would prefer ethnostates or ethnic based states did not exist, but I also wish I were handsomer and better at basketball. We have to deal with reality in that tribalism and ethnic-based states, including Palestine, are the norm. Being a minority has, for most of Jewish history, been a terrible experience. Being *any* minority in the Middle East is a precarious position (see, e.g., Yazidis). If that weren't the case, Zionism would never have emerged. Without genocidal antisemitism, there would never have been an 'ought' or a need for a \"Jewish State.\"\n\n&gt;All Palestinians are terrorists who want to kill the Jews\n\nWho makes such an argument? That's silly and untrue.\n\n&gt;The conflict started in 1917 when England established \"in Palestine... a national home for the Jewish people\" (Balfour Declaration, 1917)\n\nWell yes. Quite understandably, Palestine's Arabs, who were beginning to have a national consciousness, did not want the character of the country to be changed, without their consent, through mass immigration of Jews (or anyone else). But you should recognize that we can all play \"start the clock\" at a different time. One could argue that, since Palestine itself is the product of an imperial project - the Arab-Islamic conquests - the Jews, the last people to have an independent polity there - could claim this was illegitimate. Palestine in 1917 had about 600,000 -700,000 people - not empty, not \"a land without a people\" by any stretch, but not densely populated, this was especially true in the lowland areas where most Jewish settlement took place. And, in 1917, Palestine's border as we know it was not yet drawn - claims were made that it was a natural part of Syria (a much larger land mass). To the Jews, desperate for a home and refuge, there was plenty of room. The analogy given was a life-raft with room for 3 - if someone is in the life raft and another person is drowning in the water, the person drowning cannot get in the raft and then throw the 2 other people in the ocean. However, it would also be unjust for the two people not to make room for the 1 who would otherwise drown.\n\nJews and Palestinians did not understand each other from the outset. Jews saw plenty of space and an Arab world that stretched from the Atlantic to the Persian Gulf. That \"the Arabs\" couldn't share a tiny fraction of it, seemed like rank antisemitism. Palestinians thought more locally - this was their neighborhood, it had an Arab character for generations, upon generations, and here come foreigners trying to change things against the will of the current majority. It's possible to concede that both are, at least in an honest and subjective way, correct.\n\n&gt;From October 7, 2023–November 19, 2025 Israel has endured 1,654 fatalities and 8,295 injuries while Palestine has endured 61,158 fatalities and 151,442 injuries (Statista, 2025). This hardly feels justifiable.\n\nThere's *a lot* you could argue about the devastation in Gaza and the injustice or horror of it. It isn't at all difficult to make the pro-Palestinian argument on this one. But this ain't it. You can't just make moral judgements based on body counts. The US in WW2 killed something like 800,000+ Japanese civilians. I'm not sure if more than a handful of US civilians were killed at Pear Habor. Would one therefore conclude that the US was the villain of WW2?",

Also why almost all Mizrahi Jews ended up in Israel after their expulsion from the Arab world (basically nowhere else to go).\n\nNow, I believe the land is for both the Jews AND the Palestinians. My personal take on history is that Palestinian Nationalism rejects the idea that the Jews need a national home, utterly rejects the Jews connection to the land, and opposed the influx of Jews into the land as it would have affected the cultural makeup of the land (basically classic anti immigration stances). From this violence erupted because Palestinians rejected the influx of Jews and because the Jews had nowhere else to go.\n\nThere should be a way for the land to be shared: for Jews to have a national home and security and for the Palestinians to have the same.

Of course not all of them are.\n3. It started before that. I think you may want to look into Dhimmi status, the Ottoman abolishment of it in the 1850s, and how the Muslim population responded. It's fairly similar to how the US south responded to emancipation, which also resulted in a civil war. By 1917 Jews had already purchased a huge amount of land in the area and there were already attacks against them.\n   1. As for that Ben-Gurion quote, I think you need to read some more about it. Context matters so much at that point in time: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937\\_Ben-Gurion\\_letter#Disputed\\_text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937_Ben-Gurion_letter#Disputed_text)\n   2. Essentially, the quote may actually say the opposite. But that doesn't really matter. Benny Morris writes:\n\n&gt;elsewhere, in unassailable statements, Ben-Gurion at this time repeatedly endorsed the idea of 'transferring' (or expelling) Arabs, or the Arabs, out of the area of the Jewish state-to-be, either 'voluntarily' or by compulsion. There were good reasons for Ben-Gurion's endorsement of transfer: The British Peel Commission had proposed it, the Arabs rebelling in Palestine were bent on uprooting the Zionist enterprise, and the Jews of Europe, under threat of destruction, were in dire need of a safe haven, and Palestine could not serve as one so long as the Arabs were attacking the Yishuv and, as a result, the British were curtailing Jewish access to the country.\n\nAnd point 4) The difference in casualty numbers is irrelevant and I see it as a rather superficial point to make. It may \"feel\" like indiscriminate killing to you, but that doesn't mean it was. It is the result of a difference in military tactics and prioritization of life. Israel has taken huge steps over decades to protect its population. Hamas has done the opposite - they have embedded within and underneath its population in order to use them as a tool to de-legitimize Israel.\n\nYour train of thought is exactly as Hamas designed. They wanted to make themselves such a large threat that Israel would be forced to go after them, at which point they would use the people of Gaza as fodder and blast the casualty numbers to the world to smear the IDF. You see the destruction of Gaza, which is huge and the vast majority of the area. Yet, about 3.5% of the population was killed. That includes militant deaths, which, by design, they never distinguish, as well as some proven cases of natural deaths not related to the war. This is also a stated policy of Hamas. That would not be possible if there was indiscriminate killing. Even the worst estimate for the civilian to militant death ratio puts the war at about average for urban conflict. It is far more likely that the ratio was much lower than average, even though Hamas used human shields *literally* all the time.\n\nI also want to point out that Hamas liberally uses IEDs which often injure or kill Palestinians as well. They are truly dumb, indiscriminate weapons. All of those numbers are counted against Israel too.",

Lets be serious here, Israel hit almost every single building in Gaza.\n\nWe have plenty of IDF soldiers testimonies that they blew up buildings for fun.\n\n[https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240323-israeli-soldiers-blowing-up-homes-in-gaza-for-amusement/](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240323-israeli-soldiers-blowing-up-homes-in-gaza-for-amusement/)\n\n[https://www.un.org/unispal/document/unosat-gaza-strip-damage-assessment-31oct25/](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/unosat-gaza-strip-damage-assessment-31oct25/)\n\n&gt;hat includes militant deaths, which, by design, they never distinguish, as well as some proven cases of natural deaths not related to the war\n\nA lot of natural deaths are directly related to the war. Israel blockades on food and medicine obviously aggravated the pre-existing fragilities of people.\n\n&gt;They wanted to make themselves such a large threat that Israel would be forced to go after them, at which point they would use the people of Gaza as fodder and blast the casualty numbers to the world to smear the IDF\n\nYoure acting like the IDF was forced by Hamas to kill 20k children. It wasnt. It chose to disregard civilian casualties in its pursuit of Hamas members.\n\n[https://www.savethechildren.net/news/gaza-20000-children-killed-23-months-war-more-one-child-killed-every-hour](https://www.savethechildren.net/news/gaza-20000-children-killed-23-months-war-more-one-child-killed-every-hour)\n\n&gt;Hamas used human shields *literally* all the time\n\nCivilian being near Hamas members are not human shields, unless Hamas fighters are currently operating. You wouldnt argue that off-duty IDF soldiers are using human shields when going to the supermarket, would you?\n\nSame goes for Hamas outside of their fighting.\n\nIll add that the IDF is also a big user of human shields.\n\n[https://www.btselem.org/topic/human\\_shields](https://www.btselem.org/topic/human_shields)\n\n[https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-intel-revealed-israeli-officials-discussing-use-of-human-shields-in-gaza-sources-say/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-intel-revealed-israeli-officials-discussing-use-of-human-shields-in-gaza-sources-say/)\n\n&gt;Even the worst estimate for the civilian to militant death ratio puts the war at about average for urban conflict\n\nActually, most studies estimates that 75 to 85% of death are civilians. Thats a truly awful civilian to combattants ratio, way worse than Mosul where ISIS literally filled building with civilians.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties\\_of\\_the\\_Gaza\\_war#Civilian\\_to\\_combatant\\_ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Gaza_war#Civilian_to_combatant_ratio)",

Why should Israel not be a Jewish state?Africa: Saudi Arabia, Iran (Shia), Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan, Egypt, Algeria, Iraq, Oman, Yemen, UAE, Qatar, Libya, Tunisia, Morocco are all Muslim states. So when they denounce Islam as their national religion or Christian countries in Europe and Latin America do, then get back to me on this. Stop pretending this is an issue. It's clearly anti-semitic rhetoric because other nations have national religions. It doesn't mean those are the only people allowed to live in the nation and its the same in Israel.\n\n2. I don't know anybody that honestly thinks all Palestinians are terrorists and want to kill them, it's more along the lines of if the majority of Palestinians had their way, then the Jewish state would cease to exist and the Jews would have to leave. That doesn't provide them a place to go. The majority of Israelis now have been born there. Where should they go? The idea that Palestinians would want to kill them came from the 1940's Nakba/Independence war. I mean when the secretary General of the Arab League says its going to be a war of extermination spoken on the levels of Genghis Khan... that leaves little to interpret on intent....\n\n3. You're skipping TONS of conflict and I'm hoping you're being genuine or this is pointless. There were close to a dozen attacks on Jews by Arabs of the region before the Jews even attacked back in the 1920s also:\n\nPrior to partition plan, Palestinian Arabs did not view themselves as having a separate identity. When the First Congress of Muslim-Christian Associations met in Jerusalem in February 1919 to choose Palestinian representatives for the Paris Peace Conference, the following resolution was adopted:\n\nWe consider Palestine as part of Arab Syria, as it has never been separated from it at any time. We are connected with it by national, religious, linguistic, natural, economic and geographical bonds.\n\nIn 1937, a local Arab leader, Auni Bey Abdul-Hadi, told the Peel Commission, which ultimately suggested the partition of Palestine: \"There is no such country as Palestine! 'Palestine' is a term the Zionists invented! There is no Palestine in the Bible. Our country was for centuries part of Syria.\"\n\nThe representative of the Arab Higher Committee to the United Nations submitted a statement to the General Assembly in May 1947 that said \"Palestine was part of the Province of Syria\" and that, \"politically, the Arabs of Palestine were not independent in the sense of forming a separate political entity.\" A few years later, Ahmed Shuqeiri, later the chairman of the PLO, told the Security Council: \"It is common knowledge that Palestine is nothing but southern Syria.\"\n\nPalestinian Arab nationalism is largely a post-World War I phenomenon that did not become a significant political movement until after the 1967 Six-Day War and Israel's capture of the West Bank.\n\n4. Hamas started this war on 10/7. Devastation and casualties in war doesn't make you the victim. Japan attacked the USA and got them involved in world War 2. The US then fire bombed and nuked Japan twice killing far more Japanese civilians than American civilians died during the war. Germany invaded other nations in WW2, but how did that end up for those German civilians in Dresden? It doesn't make Germany more righteous. If you had the power and the weapons to protect your people and you have enemies north east and south of you, would you be using those weapons regularly? Why would Israel endanger their people instead of using their weapons?  \n\nI personally don't think anybody should be killed. In 2005 Gaza had elections. They elected a group with a genocidal part to their charter. The PA had the Martyr's Fund. Why should Israel lay down its defenses and why should they endanger their people?",

Except for a few minor religious matters, and its holidays being Jewish, there's no meaningful discrimination. The same cannot be said for actual ethno-states in the region like Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, which favor their Muslim majorities.\n\nThis is a classic Marxist slur and lie intended to legitimatize Israel. To remove Israel's Jewish nature and allow the unlimited return of the DESCENDANTS of actual Palestinian refugees would almost instantly lead to the expulsion, murder or vicious subjugation of its Jews (and all other non-Muslim minorities), as happened in Gaza and literally every Arab country.\n\n2 - No, but most Palestinians support Palestinian terrorists and their efforts to murder Israelis and destroy Israel. Poll after poll shows this. Classic straw man.\n\n3 - The conflict started in 1920 when local Arabs, not to refer to themselves as Palestinians for another 44 years, started murdering local Jews, because they were Jews, and their growing numbers threatened them somehow. Eventually Jews fought back, and to blame them for doing that is disingenuous and insane, supporting the view that people only like Jews when they're dead or helpless. Sorry, that ended in 1920, and will never return.\n\n4 - I partly agree with you here. I think the war was too brutal and long and could have been waged differently. But even if it had and only half as many civilians had dies (obviously the death of terrorists was not a bad thing, they chose to become terrorists and paid the price for it), you folks would still have accused Israel of the deliberately chosen blood libel of genocide. Plus, Hamas started it, not Israel. And no, it was in no way, shape or form legitimate \"resistance\"--and then to Israel's existence.\n\nSorry, yours is a tired and worn script posed in a disingenuous \"Oh I'm just asking questions\" manner. Jews legally purchased, settled and developed tracts of land on their ancestral homeland, the international community decided to grant them a modestly-sized country for their troubles and their legitimate claims, and the world's 2 billion Muslims and 400 million Arabs, possessing over 50 countries spanning vast tracts of land that dwarf Israel, have never been able to accept that, like an elephant terrified of a mouse.

In theory, Israel isn’t anything different, although because Jews are threatened worldwide Israel also works for general Jewish wellbeing globally. The main “purpose” of Israel outside being the place where Jews self-determine is to keep them safe, which it more or less has. Also, contrary to what many sources might say, Israel doesn’t necessarily have to be “Jewish only”. It’s a state for Jews like Germany is for Germans, but not only for them.\n\n2- Not a point I’d ever make. Kinda absurd tbh I have heard very few people echo the same sentiment.\n\n3- Pretty general statement. The Arabs started the armed conflict by attacking Jewish settlements first, during the mandatory period and 1948 war. Both sides planned mass expulsions, and one side a full-fledged genocide. The war itself started with an Arab attack on May 15th. You can’t sum all of this up neatly.\n\n4- Firstly, I’m not sure I agree with the statement at all. But I will address the points you mentioned related to it:\n\nThe idea that the war’s justification is annulled because of factors that occur through it is bizarre to me. The war started because of an active threat and attack on Israeli civilians. Israel figured that it needed to eliminate Hamas completely to ensure that it wouldn’t happen again. This was non-negotiable. It’s a bigger undertaking and wildly different battle than the October 7th attacks, so it’s going to have different results. October 7th attacks lasted 2 days or so. The war was 2 years long. Figures the results would be different, no? The justification still stands.\n\n&gt;If the numbers were equal\n\nWar doesn’t have to be equal. WW2 saw a very unequal casualty rate. The rates are created by many factors like technological superiority, manpower, density, etc. In this case, it’s overwhelmingly in the favour of Israel and not Hamas or the Palestinians.",

Israelite refered to the people who were from there in ye olden times. Judea is a region there, and is the etymological origin of the word Jew. \n\n\nJewish could mean a follower of Judaism, or an ethnic Jew. Not all ethnic Jews practice the religion. And not all practicing Jews were born Jewish (in fact, disproportionately they weren't). But conversion to Judaism is a years-long process akin to naturalization, not getting sprinkled with water and saying you like Oily Josh, or whatever quick and easy process Islam takes that historically Muslims have been able to get Jews executed by saying \"oh, this person secretly and privately converted to Islam\" and then they're declared apostates and executed when they deny it. \n\n\nYes, this has actually happened. Why you would want these sort of people to control... Literally anything at all is beyond me. Why you think Jews should tolerate it, only you can explain. If someone tried to do that to me, I wouldn't pity them after they died. I'd seriously question the morality of anyone who did. \n\n\nI'd especially question the morality of someone arguing that the fact that they got themselves and their \"loved ones\" killed in order to enslave me means they clearly deserved to enslave me in the first place. ",

But it seems like most “pro-Palestinian people” are anti-Israel. They want Israel gone. Which places an existential threat against Israel and makes people who support Israel in turn frustrated by pro Palestinians. I’m very confused as to why anyone is “pro-Palestinian” and not “pro peace for both Palestinians and Israelis.” Israel has come to the bargaining table so many times but they’ve yet to have a reasonable non terrorist party on the other side of the table to negotiate with. \n\nSometimes I feel like the pro Palestinian folks have never read a history book, have no idea what they’re supporting, and get their news from TikTok. You’d think Israel was taking over the world, rather than a speck of insignificant dust in the middle of a MASSIVE Arab colonization and expulsion. Yikes.\n\nIt also amazes me the folks like OP who “don’t believe in ethno religious states” yet have no idea what this means or any issue with again the massive Arab ethno religious states. They claim issues with Israel yet make no issue about any of those Arab states infringing upon women’s rights. They don’t attempt to blame Hamas for the problems of the Palestinian people despite Israel leaving Gaza in 2005. Also, Palestine is seeking an ethno religious state, and even though Arabs and Christian’s live in Israel, Jews and Christian’s would not be welcome in Palestine. So you don’t support ethno religious states, but you do for Palestine? Explain the contradiction to me because the math doesn’t make sense. You literally said you are pro something for Palestine but anti that same thing for Israel. \n\n“The conflict started…” again with misinformation.\n\nComparisons of fatalities is also massively flawed. Israel has sustained fewer casualties because of the iron dome and better protection of its people. Hamas and Iran who backs Hamas do not care at all about the Palestinians. In fact, Palestinians dying is more ammo for them to show the world how bad Israel is. They build tunnels and operations in schools and hospitals. No other country would paper entire areas and warn people to leave, but Israel did. \n\nBeing pro Palestinian, for those who truly are, isn’t about being anti Israel, it’s about being anti Hamas, anti Iran, anti terrorism, and PRO PEACE with Israel. The empty virtue signaling of free Palestine at Israel’s expense does absolutely nothing for Palestinians. Anyone who is not seeking peace and normalization of relations does not truly care about Palestinians.",

The Balfour declaration was repudiated by the UK in 1930 with the Palestine White Paper, which placed strict restrictions on Jewish immigration and on Jewish purchasing of land. During the 1948 war, which started when the combined forces of 7 Arab countries invaded Israel, Palestinian populations were urged by the invading Arabs to flee Palestine, with the promise that it would be temporary and that they could return to their homes after the Jews were defeated and killed. Whoever told you Palestine's population has been shrinking has lied to you. The Palestinian population has only ever grown over time. There are far more Palestinians today than there were in 1948. Tangentially, by contrast the Jewish population today is still smaller than it was in 1930.  \n4. Far more Germans were killed in WWII than Americans or Brits. German cities like Berlin were flattened just as much as Gaza. Surely no one would imply that because Germany suffered more casualties, that Germany was the victim.

The fact that the Central Elections Committee voted 28 to 5 to ban Kach specifically because it was racist and anti-democratic really shows how different things used to be. You’re right to feel uneasy, because we’ve gone from Likud actively pushing to ban these people to Netanyahu playing a central role in bringing their ideas into the political mainstream just to hold together a governing coalition.\n\nSadly, the numbers support your concern about how fast this shift has happened. In the 2022 elections, the Religious Zionism alliance, which includes and protects these Kahanist ideas, didn’t barely make it into parliament, they became the third largest party in the Knesset with 14 seats and close to 11% of the total vote. That means a large part of the public openly supported ideas that were legally considered too extreme and dangerous to even be allowed in parliament just thirty years ago. Seeing Ben Gvir go from a young activist convicted of inciting racism to becoming the National Security Minister in charge of the police represents a deep structural change, not just a temporary political moment.\n\nIt really feels like what used to be called the “fringe” is no longer on the sidelines; it now holds real power. When senior government ministers openly align themselves with Kahane’s ideology and control both the West Bank administration and the police, the more pragmatic and restrained Likud of the 1980s is basically gone. Making this kind of ethnic supremacy and messianic authoritarian thinking seem normal is deeply isolating and pushes away a huge portion of the Jewish diaspora, many of whom cannot square their values with a government that openly embraces these ideas.",

    "body": "It frightens me too and whilst I agree with your post, I have an even more pessimistic explanation for the rise. \n\nBasically, I think Kahanism is the logical point for a society built on ethnic superiority founded with the ethnic cleansing of the indigenous population. \n\nYou can arrive on the land with grand ideals about socialism, liberalism and democracy, but pretty soon they are going to come into conflict with main project of zionism, that being the displacement of one ethnic group and the creation of a state for another. \n\nWe saw that in a microcosm with the socialist settlers. They came to the land with the idea of emancipating all workers through unionisation and worker democracy, but that came into conflict with Avoda Ivrit, the idea of Hebrew Labour. They try and square the circle and create separate Arab labour unions, but that doesn't work as they still need to control them, and by the time 1948 comes around, socialist groups were some of the greediest groups for taking expropriated Arab land. Zeev Sternhell's book is really required reading on this topic I think. \n\nSimilar story with the centre-left liberal ruling Ashkenazi elite of Israel over the last few decades. They bend themselves into pretzels trying to solve the incompatibility of Israel being both a Jewish state and a liberal secular democracy, and then fall prey to the more radical religious elements within that say... why try and be both? The Jewish state part is far more important to us, so let's drop the pretense and just focus on that. \n\nOf course the elite of Israel have themselves to blame for another key reason too - namely the way they treated the Mizrahim who they brought in to Israel after they arrived. It's no coincidence that the far right Israeli parties find their base of support among poorer Misrahi communities, just due to the elitism and let's be honest overt racism shown toward them by the richer and more educated European elites. \n\nIt's a shift that I think is only going to get worse in the coming decades. We've already seen mass emigration out of Israel since Oct 7 because living in a nation at war is not an appealing life to most people who have options. The people leaving tend to be richer more educated and more liberal Israelis with dual nationality, which causes the remaining Israeli society to shift further to the right. This then further alienates Israel from Jews living in the west, which means it becomes more reliant on Christian fundamentalists and right wing despots for support, etc. \n\nIt's a pretty bleak picture and I share your worry. Obviously the rightward shift isn't just an Israeli phenomenon, but the specific characteristics of Israel may make it much more damaging there than in other places.",

They are very intentionally benefiting from violence, or in what violence makes available to them (influence, customers, resources, assets—e.g. land).",

Diaspora Judaism: Modern Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, Reconstructionist...  does offer an alternative, but Israelis as a people, including in decades past, never took to it.  Given that Israel puts so much stake in \"Jewish\", something has to fill that void.  Neo-Zionism for all its flaws is at least a religion of a free people.  \n\n2.  Israel has a decidedly populist culture.  The Israeli Left, the professional class, is not comfortable in their own skin.  Netanyahu's views of them, and their own inability to come up with a present-day national vision, have gotten into their head.  \n\n3.

Half the population want a Social Democratic European State just in the Middle East not Europe; half the population wants a Middle Eastern state just with Judaism in place of Islam.  Netanyahu's \"traitor\" label has stuck.  Not just with a percentage of the public but in their own heads.    Because Europe is often acting against Israel's interest it is harder to defend the connections with Europe, the West. The core of what they are fighting for are Western values the former vision.  But in their mind, Europe defines Western values, and if those values are anti-Israel, they are traitorous.  \n\nThis is what I meant by not comfortable in their own skin.  \n\nThe next most serious problem, the underlying reason for the problem above is that Oslo failed.  The Palestinians didn't negotiate in good faith.  The Israeli Left hasn't really unified around what to do if there won't be negotiated peace.  They can't put this issue to bed until they convince Israelis they have either changed their position or their old position was right and it was just bad circumstances (i.e., Iran, for example).  And this goes deeper because for most of them they themselves don't believe the failure was circumstance, rather they were wrong about the single most important issue of the last 2 generations. \n\nAnd they can't duck this.  More deeply what the Left wants probably means an increase in deaths from terrorism even if it were to work.  To sell this policy they have to be willing to stand up and say, yes the excess deaths are worth it.  Which is Zionism, but they themselves aren't sure anymore. \n\nThey were also wrong about Communism.  Back in the 1930s what became Herut then Likud tilted market while what became Labour tilted Socialist and Communist.  The Left doesn't want to live on a Kibbutz either.  \n\nThey see themselves as Israel, but as a percentage of the population they have been shrinking since 1950.  They can't decide if they are an influential, wealthy population faction or the dominant population.  They obviously aren't the later objectively, but they haven't gotten that.  They are generally educated professional class.  Leftwing parties don't like being the Moderate Republican party, same issue the Democrats are having as they absorb more Never Trump Republicans and lose working class whites.  \n\nThat gets compounded by a total inability to unify around leadership.  Unlike the Right which has had Netanyahu for a generation, and when not Netanyahu Sharon.   The Left undercut one another rather than build one another up.  This makes it easy to unify around \"anti-Netanyahu\" but then they stand for nothing else.  Which makes people not see them as an alternative ...",

He will certainly not win, but if he will actually be in office he can get a serious position and have enough seats to do something with it. Or at least become a major opposition leader. He is strong, clear, and has vision. Unlike the previous leftist politicians. Some of whom I voted for and yet still struggle to recall their names.",

A few factors led to the changes we see now: 1) the 1967 war and the capture of historical biblical territories which galvanized the messianic religious Zionists and the settler movement who were extremely tiny previous; 2) the imports of 800,000 Jews from the Middle-East and North Africa in the 1950s that were not treated very well who ended up hating the Labour party and voting for Likud in the 1977 elections; 3) the failure of Oslo, the 2nd intifada and suicide bombs in the late 90s and early 2000s.\n\nIsrael's liberal leaders I would say are the former generals Gadi Eisenkot and Yair Golan, but they don't have enough support to actually beat Netanyahu in the election. Israeli society has shifted so right-wing that former right-wing extremists like Naftali Bennett and Avigdor Lieberman are seen as center moderates.\n\nTom Segev, the prominent Israeli historian, wrote a fantastic article in Haaretz a few months ago basically saying the old liberal elite consists of 200,000 people in Tel-Aviv who protest and desire for the old Israel, but are slowly dying out...this is what I see as well.\n\nSEGEV - \n\n\"I found myself at a demonstration on Azza Street, near the grocery store where I shop. And it occurred to me that 200,000 people – that's what there is. The nation is not divided and not torn. There is no parity between \\[the numbers of\\] supporters and opponents of the regime coup. The nation supports Netanyahu. Who doesn't support him? The 200,000 people who are defending their status as an obsolete elite.\n\n\"There won't be a civil war,\" he continues, \"because the demonstrators will not bring about a war and the other side in any case constitutes the majority. And as far as that goes, Israeli democracy was never real. For 20 years all the Arabs \\[in Israel\\] were under martial law, and then came the Six-Day War, and thereafter the entire population there \\[in the territories\\] was under that form of regime.\"",

Yes, it is awful what many Gazans have gone through, but even to this day, Israel has NEVER COME CLOSE, to the barbarity of Hamas and their counterparts. \n\nFrankly, this Iran led anti-Israel coalition, with their track record, of Hezbollah giving a reminder that all gays should be put to death, the IRGC raping it's own civilians, the Muslim MS-13 (Hamas), and now the Taliban, this might be the most inhumane military alliance in modern history.",
