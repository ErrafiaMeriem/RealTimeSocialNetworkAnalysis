    "selftext": "I don’t understand why most Israelis/Zionists are shocked or confused by the growing hatred\n\nWith the exception of a few self-aware commentators, almost every Israeli and Zionist I encounter seems to be genuinely bewildered by the intensifying global hatred for Israel. This is honestly amazing to me.\n\nFrom my POV as a former Liberal Zionist, the reason is almost comically obvious: Israel is oppressing, expelling, and killing Palestinians for the benefit of Jews, and Israel is doing all of this with the unceasing support of virtually every Western gov’t along with nearly all organized mainstream Jewish institutions.\n\nFor anyone who is not already invested in the Zionist project, this looks absolutely insane and cruel. Israel has been bombing Gaza non-stop since the so-called “ceasefire”, with nearly 500 Palestinians killed in that time. Israel will never face any consequences for that. If another country that wasn’t aligned with the West committed the exact same actions as Israel, it would be sanctioned into oblivion and condemned unequivocally by almost every Western gov’t. Meanwhile with Israel, not only does Israel generally avoid sanction and serious condemnation, Israel receives impassioned rhetorical defenses and direct military support from the West. Most people notice this hypocrisy.\n\nThe bottom line is that the primary driver of the growing global hatred of Israelis and Zionists is sympathy for the suffering and struggle of Palestinians at the hands of Israel. Israelis don’t get that sympathy because they are not being oppressed by anyone, they themselves are doing the oppressing, and they are doing it with virtual impunity.\n\nI’m asking this seriously: Why would Israelis/Zionists expect anyone to sympathize with the Israelis in light of this context?",

Some reports suggest that several hundred protesters have been murdered in the last 24 hours. And the regimes' crackdown is intensifying with every passing hour. I have posted about a possible intervention by Israel and the US a few days back and as the regime has crossed Trumps red line multiple times, it seems to me that the window of oppertunity for a successful intervention might not be open for much longer.\n\nAnalysts propose some viable options before a military strike into Iran itself. Mostly seizing it's oil tankers, as this would massively decrease the regimes revenue and ability to pay its goons and militias. Especially Israel could help the protesters via cyberattacks against the IRGC and the security forces, to hinder their coordination and demoralise them as well. And lastly, striking the compounds and bases of the IRGC, basij and security forces. Supplying protesters with weapons seems far fetched at the moment and as the regime is now mercilessly mowing down protesters the best course of action is to attack these forces directly.\n\nI dearly hope that outside intervention won't be necessary. Given that the regime is being so hellbent on survival and showing no remorse and especially having its own army with the IRGC, to me it seems the protesters need some kind of outside assistance to overthrow this vile regime. If Trump doesn't intervene after all this promises he has the blood of thousands of Iranians on his hands...     Free Iran from ☪️ancer🦁🇮🇷🙏🏽",

    "selftext": "I came to this sub reddit to understand the opinions of Israeli’s directly. I had another post intended to understand Smotrich and Ben Gvir in the context of how Isreali’s felt about them. It was really helpful, and I feel like learned a lot. Unfortunately, I’m also disillusioned…\n\nMany, many of the responses would reflexively pivot away from the topic to some version of the following:\n\n•\t⁠the Palestinians (generalized group) want to kill us and eliminate Israel\n•\t⁠isreali’s are exhausted with peace, and after Oct. 7th are no longer hopeful for a peaceful solution.\n•\t⁠isreal is a democracy with varying political opinion and beliefs, some of which should not be assumed to represent a sizable portion of the country. Buuuuuuut… that same thinking cannot be extended to pro-Palestinian supporters or Palestinian opinions on peace or violence as a whole.\n•\t⁠reflexive “but you know what they did?” “Here is what they think!” “What about Hamas” so on and so forth\n\nThere is no room to discuss what those you disagree with want, feel, think, etc. it is immediately assumed they all feel the same way and have the same goals. Everything is sent through the prism of “us vs. them”. It is not possible to discuss for instance, the deaths of Gazans alongside the deaths of isreali’s. One was an unprovoked attack, and the other is merely collateral damage. This of course implies that maybe there is no such thing as an innocent Palestinian.\n\nThere is so much anger. So much intrenched, rigid rhetoric. Forget peace, we can’t even acknowledge our shared humanity. Everyone is an enemy unless they support us.\n\nSome of you will read this and empathize. Others will simply respond “but what about the evil fill in the blank.\n\nWhat I think will happen: Israel will take Gaza, or at least a sizable portion of it, and displace Palestinians. Those in the West Bank will never have a sovereign country. They will eventually be killed or removed as well, possibly following another attack or just slowly by Israeli extremist provicateurs. Isreal will “win”, whatever that may mean.  There will never be peace, because there is no reason for it.\n\nThe perspective that this may not be fair or just for Palestinians, will be responded with some version of “they asked for it”, “they refused to be a partner for peace”, or “they attacked us”. Therefore, the Palestinian living in Jerusalem only has himself to blame, or his leaders.\n\nSo the same impulse that murdered Rabin is not the same impulse that planned Oct. 7th. Extremism and murder are not the same, but merely justified and defended.\n\nWe don’t believe in a shared human experience. We don’t believe all humans are created equal and deserve equal respect. We are not interested in why some people are angry or have opinions that differ from us. We believe in tribes, and you are either in the club or you’re a problem.\n\nEDIT: some of the responses here have been helpful for me (selfishly). I do feel I have a better understanding. I can appreciate now: why many Israeli’s need the dialogue to start with an acknowledgement that Hamas is responsible for the events of the last several years. I’m willing to extend that understanding as a basis for the conversation. Can we discuss our shared humanity and the plight of peoples using that as a springboard? Thank you. ",

    "selftext": "For the past two years, one of the most common explanations I have heard for why Americans care so intensely about Gaza is this claim:\n\n“U.S. tax dollars are paying for the bombs being dropped on Palestinian civilians.”\n\nThat framing has been central to protests, campus activism, and political pressure, especially among people who otherwise say they oppose U.S. involvement in foreign wars.\n\nAt the same time, many people also recognize a degree of hypocrisy in this position. The United States funds or enables military actions that cause civilian harm in many places around the world, yet only Israel Palestine has generated this level of sustained moral outrage, protest culture, and personal identification. Comparable or worse humanitarian crises often receive minimal attention.\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu has now suggested publicly that within roughly ten years Israel will no longer need or receive U.S. military aid, as Israel becomes more militarily self sufficient.\n\nThat raises a serious question:\n\nIf U.S. military aid ends, does American public engagement with the Israel Palestine conflict meaningfully decrease, or does the justification for caring simply change?\n\nSome related questions I am curious about:\n\n\t•\tIf U.S. tax dollars are no longer funding Israeli weapons, does this conflict start to resemble other foreign wars Americans largely observe at a distance, such as Ethiopia, Yemen, or Sudan?\n\n\t•\tIf not, what becomes the new pretext for prioritizing Israel Palestine above other comparable situations? Is it civilian casualties, identity politics, religious connections, symbolism, or something else?\n\n\t•\tWill the argument shift from “we are funding this” to “we are enabling this diplomatically” through UN vetoes, trade relationships, or intelligence cooperation?\n\n\t•\tAnd for supporters of the protest movement, how do they reconcile the selective focus on Israel with relative silence on other U.S. backed or U.S. adjacent conflicts that also involve large scale civilian harm?\n\nI am genuinely interested in whether U.S. taxpayer involvement is the real driver of American attention, or whether it has functioned mainly as a convenient moral framing layered on top of deeper political, cultural, and ideological commitments.\n\nCurious to hear thoughtful perspectives from all sides.",

    "selftext": "This is a side of the debate I do not see discussed frequently.\n\nIsrael is a people. Judea is a nation. Names, borders, and empires have changed repeatedly, across Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman, and British rule, yet the people persist. It is my opinion that the current debate confuses the two, treating ancient history like a current argument.\n\n“Palestine” comes from the Hebrew Pelesheth, meaning “Land of the Philistines.” The Romans later applied it to Judea after crushing a series of major revolts, most notably Bar Kokhba, literally attempting to erase Jewish identity. Britain revived the term administratively under the Mandate, turning it into a political label for governance purposes. Arabs adopting it as a national identity is largely a 20th-century phenomenon, perhaps in part a reaction to the return of Jewish sovereignty, but the idea that this terminology is an ancient plan to erase Israel is historically absurd. Ironically, both “Palestine” and “Israel” are politically loaded labels designed to propagandize, yet few are willing to confront that fact.\n\nFinally, most Jews, Palestinians, Israelis, and Arabs do not hold personal responsibility for the decisions of political elites. Blood guilt, and collective moral essentialism are morally and intellectually bankrupt concepts and irrespective of what’s happening in the strip they have no place in the conversation. Understanding history, separating identity from politics, and rejecting collective blame is the only way to have a conversation that actually gets past propaganda, tribalism, and outrage.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Why do you think so few people are willing to confront the history behind these names? Does insisting on historical nuance actually help prevent moral essentialism in these debates? What would a debate that fully accounted for historical, linguistic, and moral nuance even look like? Or do you just think I’m full of kak? Let me know.\n\nEDIT: I love this post’s replies, even though I disagree with some of you (or you with each other), you all taught me a lot. Every time I invite discourse on subjects as complex as these, I am reminded of how little I know and the importance of listening more than I speak. I encourage everyone to listen to each other a little bit more and focus on the shared piece of humanity and the divine spark we all share.

Not academically. \n\nRight now.!!\n\nPeople are being beaten, shot, arrested, tortured, and killed in the streets for standing up to their own regime. Women are harassed and assaulted by morality police. Protesters vanish into prisons. Families are silenced through fear. None of this is controversial. None of this is unclear.\n\nAnd yet… silence.\nNo flotillas.\nNo viral hashtags.\nNo constant Instagram stories.\nNo moral outrage marathons.\n\nThe same people who suddenly find endless energy, passion, and certainty when it comes to Israel are nowhere to be found.\n\nWhen Israel is involved, the response is instant and aggressive. The world becomes black and white. There is no room for nuance, context, or even basic questions. If you hesitate or ask for balance, you’re immediately labeled immoral, complicit, or evil.\n\nBut when an authoritarian Islamist regime openly brutalizes its own civilians, those loud voices suddenly go quiet. Or worse, they hide behind vague phrases like “it’s complicated” or simply move on.\n\nLet’s be clear: this isn’t empathy.\nIt isn’t courage.\nIt isn’t moral consistency.\nIt’s selective outrage.\n\nIf your concern for civilians depends on who the oppressor is, then your values aren’t universal. Dead civilians in Tehran are not less tragic than dead civilians anywhere else. A woman beaten by Iranian morality police does not deserve less outrage because her abuser doesn’t fit a preferred activist narrative.\n\nWhat really bothers me is the hypocrisy wrapped in moral superiority. These activists speak as if they own the definition of justice, while applying it selectively. They don’t stand for humanity. They stand for a side.\n\nAnd let’s be honest about why. Criticizing Israel is socially rewarded in many activist circles. It brings applause, validation, and visibility. Criticizing Iran costs you allies, likes, and ideological comfort. So silence becomes the easier option.\n\nBut silence here is not neutrality.\nIt’s a choice.\n\nIf your activism can’t condemn oppression everywhere with the same voice and the same intensity, then stop calling it activism. Call it what it really is: politics dressed up as morality.\nReal humanism doesn’t follow trends.\n\nIt doesn’t pick enemies.\nIt picks principles.\n\nSo let me know if you agree with me or not !!!",

I've not seen any recent unabridged quotes that do the ethnic and religious without throwing in a vague \"and everyone else\"\n\nAt first (given Bondi) I was wondering if It was real, but Daesh rather than Hamas, and then Hasbara decided to signal boost it (because they always help Daesh spread their propaganda)\n\nBut it's attributed to Hamas, and not Hamas as a euphemism for al Qassam, actual political wing. They often call for protests. And they very specifically don't call for violence outside of the borders of British Palestine (the only exception I've even heard of is violence against Daesh in Syria, and some vague greetings to resistance fighters in ongoing battles elsewhere).\n\nThis is actually an entirely reasonable and peaceful action that is typical of how they usually act. But I've been unsure of how much to point it out because it wouldn't get \"most of the actions Hamas take are non-violent\" instead of gets twisted into \"the protesters are terrorists\"!!\n\nBecause they actually have been calling for this since 7 October, they called for attacks on Israel, and protests / boycotts / prayer elsewhere. Even in East Jerusalem they sometimes suggested unarmed actions. There is room for disingenuous interpretation \n\nMeanwhile, the neonazi rally in Sydney in November got a police approval!?\n\nDaesh called for violence against Jews and Christians worldwide, but I don't think they had anything specific for that day.

    "selftext": "I had a conversation with a Palestinian who suddenly went full antisemite and started saying Jews were lying about their heritage, and every aspect of their heritage that they preserved for thousands of years is a lie. Edit: I've seen tons of Pro-Palestinians say these same things over and over. Specifically, they rant antisemitic conspiracy theories like:\n\n* \"Jews are just European converts pretending to be related to ancient Israelites.\" Genetic studies make it obvious this is nonsense, as anyone who has been on a DNA subreddit or looked at any genetic studies about this can tell. This conspiracy theories is often accompanied by the long debunked Khazar theory -- also disproved by the discovery of DNA. Also accompanied by the also nonsense claim that Israel makes DNA tests illegal to hide Jews' real origins — as though plenty of Jews in the disapora don't exist and can take DNA tests.)\n* \"Modern Hebrew is actually Arabic and not related to Ancient Hebrew.\" This is obvious nonsense — as any modern Hebrew speaker knows, modern Hebrew is just ancient Hebrew with more words and some mild grammatical changes. Modern Hebrew speakers can read ancient Hebrew just fine. They cannot, however, understand Arabic, because it is a totally different language, and Arabs cannot understood Hebrew either. The language had a revival, it was not invented from scratch, and certainly not from Arabic.\n* \"Jews steal Palestinian clothes.\" That was a new one for me, no idea what they mean by it. Kind of proves that they are just throwing everything at the wall to deny Jewish identity. Also, seems quite obvious that Palestinians wear Western clothes.\n* \"Jews steal Palestinian food.\" Jews have lived in Israel for thousands of years continuously and have been making and eating the food traditional to that place too. When Jewish refugees joined the Jews already living in Israel, they started eating that food too. Being a minority doesn't mean you don't eat or cook. Besides, Palestinians eat plenty of originally Turkish food ... So what?\n\n**I didn't make this post to debate these things — they're pretty obvious antisemitic garbage that folds upon any good faith examination. What I am interested in is the why.**\n\n* Why do so many Muslims and Pro-Palestinians feel so threatened by the clear indigenous Levant culture and heritage of Jews that they have to make up lies about it? If they have to lie to uphold their beliefs, doesn't that indicate their beliefs are wrong and their entire movement is based on lies?\n* Do any of them feel guilty for supporting a movement where they know they have to lie about a persecuted indigenous culture to believe in?\n* How can they say they aren't antisemites when these offensive things about Jewish heritage apply to all Jews, not just the ones in Israel?\n* And for the Pro-Palestinians who haven't gone down their heritage denying rathole — does the fact that so many of your compatriots have make you reflect on your movement, and wonder if it's based in prejudice and racial supremacy? Do you try to correct them, or do you think it's okay for them to spread racist lies about a minority \"for the greater good\" or something?\n\nEdit: Some people here say that I made up imaginary Pro-Palestinians, and Pro-Palestinians actually never say these things. Here's a quote from this very subreddit from a Pro-Palestinian:\n\n*\"You copy our clothing, you copy our food, you copy our music, you even constructed your false language using ours as a basis. You are absolutely obsessed with us ... You are absolutely obsessed with us. You are occupiers, but you are also stalkers ... \"*\n\nAnd then when I explained that hebrew is not copied Arabic, they said:\n\n*\"How amusing that you don’t even know how modern Hebrew was created. There’s no point discussing further with someone so ignorant about his own false language. I suggest you start reading instead of posting your pathetic feelings.\"*",

Given this information, what exactly defines \"Indigenous\"? Are the English indigenous to England? Or are the Finns indigenous to Finland? Trick question, both of these ethnicities immigrated to what is now their respective countries from different parts of the world, yet today they are seen as \"indigenous\" to these lands.\n\nMoreover, are all humans technically indigenous to Africa since that's where the earliest humans originated from? By that logic, Afrikaners are not technically colonizers, then, since they are returning to the \"respective homelands\" of their ancestors. By now, you see how inconsistent the definition of \"Indigenous\" is. A more accurate statement would be the longevity of your specific ethnicity and its connection to said land. Assuming you are Ashkenazi Jewish or a 5th-generation descendant of Palestinian Refugees, that does not make you \"Indigenous\" to Israel or Palestine. It means you have ancestors who historically lived in these areas, but that does not mean you automatically have an unquestionable right to live there because you are \"indigenous\".",

Sa’ar arrived on an official visit to Somaliland on January 6, 2026, where he also met with the country’s president.\n\nSince Israel announced its recognition of Somaliland on December 26, 2025, a wave of condemnatory statements has swept across the Arab world, expressing support for the Somali state and its right to self-determination. As part of the growing backlash, Somalia has requested an urgent debate in the United Nations Security Council on Israeli recognition of Somaliland; the debate took place on December 29, 2025 and did not result in any condemnatory resolutions or even votes.\n\nSomaliland was historically a British protectorate and briefly gained independence in 1960 before merging with Somalia. Due to political instability and conflict, it later declared independence.\n\nSomaliland is located near the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, a major global shipping route; an estimated 12% of world trade passes through it. Now, the port of Berbera is becoming a strategically important trade and logistics hub. The port and military base are seen as a vantage point for monitoring the Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandab Strait, monitoring Yemeni military activity, including missile and drone launches, and monitoring Iranian naval movements.\n\nThis role fits in with Israel’s broader efforts to balance the influence of key regional powers, particularly Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and Turkey’s expanding strategic presence in Somalia. In particular, the recognition of Somaliland creates a new – Hamas, Gaza, Syria, Kurds – confrontation between Israel and Turkey.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThis is an English summary of my Finnish article.[*”Somalimaan strateginen merkitys”*](https://arielfi.wordpress.com/2026/01/06/somalimaan-strateginen-merkitys/) ",

    "selftext": "Unfortunately I feel I must preface this by saying this is obviously NOT about Jewish people, Judaism, or Individual Israelis.Unfortunately I feel I must preface this by saying this is obviously an opinion not a declaration of fact, made about a state apparatus; NOT about Jewish people, Judaism, or Individual Israelis.\n\nIn Christian theology, the antichrist isn’t defined simply as something violent or evil. It’s defined by contradiction, claiming moral righteousness while acting in direct opposition to the values it invokes (justice, mercy, restraint, and protection of the innocent), while demanding loyalty and suppressing dissent. Taken symbolically, that framework is useful for evaluating how modern states justify their use of power.\n\nFrom that perspective, the modern Israeli state increasingly operates as a system that places itself above accountability. Its actions are consistently framed as defensive and necessary, historical trauma is treated as a standing moral exemption, and international law is applied selectively, if at all. Civilian casualties are minimized, legal criticism is reframed as hostility, and external scrutiny is treated as persecution rather than oversight. These are not isolated incidents; they are patterns of behavior.\n\nU.S. Christian nationalism plays a central role in sustaining this dynamic. By turning a modern nation-state into a sacred cause, it blurs the line between faith and policy. Criticism becomes heresy/ antisemitism, accountability becomes betrayal, and unconditional support becomes a moral requirement. As someone who spent decades inside hierarchical institutions, this logic is familiar. When authority wraps itself in moral absolutism, questioning it is treated as disloyalty rather than responsibility.\n\nWhen a state demands belief instead of evidence, exemption instead of law, and loyalty instead of accountability... while invoking sacred language to justify real world harm; it fits the antichrist archetype in the way the concept was originally intended. A warning about systems that claim righteousness while operating beyond restraint.\n\nIf the antichrist or false prophet is understood symbolically as a system that cloaks power in moral righteousness while placing itself beyond accountability, then it is at least plausible to apply that lens to the modern state of Israel. The persistent demand for unconditional loyalty, the framing of criticism as moral deviance, and the selective suspension of law are not theological claims but observable patterns of state behavior. At minimum, that alignment makes the comparison analytically defensible, even if one ultimately rejects the conclusion.",

A lot of the discussions I have typically end in a screaming match, and we don't get anywhere in understanding the other person's position; I genuinely want to understand your POV. I'll list some Pro-Israel arguments that I've heard (I'm honestly trying not to present a strawman, but like I said, I don't fully understand your position) and my argument against it. Please rebut any argument I have made that you disagree with and be open to a civil discussion.\n\n1. Israel ought to exist as a nation for Jewish people.\n   * I don't believe an ethno-religious-state has a right to exist. Please note my wording. I am *not* saying that \"Israel has no right to exist,\" but that Israel as a country established strictly for Jewish people has no right to exist. This claim is not catered for a Jewish state; I oppose any state that aims for its entire population to be that of a single racial or religious group: Afghanistan, Iran, China, Pakistan, Egypt, etc.\n2. All Palestinians are terrorists who want to kill the Jews.\n   * To make such a broad-sweeping claim is disingenuous to the issue at hand. Of course, there are some Palestinians who want to eradicate all the Jews, just as there are some Israelis who want to eradicate all the Palestinians (I say some, but in a conflict as large and ongoing as this, it's likely that \"most\" could be applied to both parties). But to say \"all\" feels like an attempt by those in power to sway the opinion of the people.\n3. Palestinians started this conflict.\n   * The conflict started in 1917 when England established \"in Palestine... a national home for the Jewish people\" (Balfour Declaration, 1917) and was furthered in 1948 when Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion said, \"We must expel Arabs and take their places…and, if we have to use force...then we have force at our disposal.\" (Nur Masahla, Expulsion of the Palestinians, p. 66) During which, over 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from British-controlled Mandatory Palestine. Since then, Palestine's borders and population have been shrinking.\n4. This is the price of war. \n   * From October 7, 2023–November 19, 2025 Israel has endured 1,654 fatalities and 8,295 injuries while Palestine has endured 61,158 fatalities and 151,442 injuries (Statista, 2025). This hardly feels justifiable. I'd be more inclined to agree if the numbers were similar, but Palestine has experience nearly 21x more damage than Israel. It feels like indiscriminate killing. Not to mention that Gaza has been flattened and now the Palestinians are living in tents because their homes are unlivable.\n\nThis post is taking longer than I anticipated, so I'll leave it at this. I hope we can have a constructive conversation. If you'd like me to elaborate on anything or if you have any sources for me to look up please share.",

In 1988, Israel’s Central Election Commission disqualified Kach from participating in elections on the grounds that it was racist and undemocratic, acting under legislation specifically designed to bar Kahane’s movement. Likud MK Dan Meridor publicly expressed shock at Kahane’s proposals, which included banning sexual relations between Jews and non-Jews, segregating Jewish and Arab neighborhoods, and prohibiting any meetings between Jewish and Arab youth.\n\nSee this 1988 NYT Article: [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/06/world/israel-bans-kahane-party-from-election.html](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/06/world/israel-bans-kahane-party-from-election.html)\n\n\"The Central Election Commission today banned Rabbi Meir Kahane's party from parliamentary elections next month on the grounds that it is racist and undemocratic. The commission ruling, on a vote of 28 to 5, was made under a law written three years ago specifically to disqualify Rabbi Kahane's Kach party from elections. Rabbi Kahane, an American emigre, advocates forcible expulsion of all 2.2 million Arabs from Israel and its occupied territories...Dan Meridor, a Parliament member from Likud, said he had been shocked by some of the bills and motions Rabbi Kahane placed before Parliament in the last four years. Among them were bills, all of them unsuccessful, that would have prohibited sexual relations between Jews and non-Jews. Another would have separated Arab and Jewish neighborhoods. And still another would have forbidden meetings of any sort between Arab and Jewish youths.\"\n\nToday, however, ideological heirs of Kahane, such as Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, hold senior ministerial positions in the Israeli government. These figures openly embrace Jewish supremacist, authoritarian, and homophobic views, and promote a fanatical messianic vision that demands Jewish settlement of the entire biblical Land of Israel to hasten the coming of the Messiah.\n\nThe danger is that these once-fringe ideas are now being normalized. Likud, having sidelined or expelled many of its more liberal and pragmatic voices (previous moderates like Meridor, Begin, Ya-aalon etc. have been purged by Netanyahu from the Likud) increasingly supports or enables these extremists, allowing their rhetoric to enter the political mainstream.\n\nThis trajectory is deeply damaging: it is bad for Israel, bad for Jews worldwide, and likely to fuel both antisemitism and further radicalization.\n\nI am deeply worried.",

The IDF has the best up to date technology that any country can have. \n\nHowever, this type of Israel-Gaza war is entirely different. Gaza is choked off with a blockade from both Egypt and Israel, land, sea, and there are restrictions as much as possible. No one and I mean no one could have expected Hamas to pull off what it pulled off in October. How can Israel allow Hamas to dictate the terms and deal of a so called ceasefire? How did Israel defeat Egypt, Syria, Jordan in past wars but can’t defeat Hamas? I see that Hezbollah and Israel might go to war, and there may thousands of iran backed fighters entering Lebanon to fight. What the heck happened to Israel Invincibility? This is a serious question and I don’t pick sides here.",

They'll scream about freeing Palestine from \"the river to the sea\" (a pejorative term and call for destruction of jews and Israelis by the way), but I only hear radio silence on this issue.\n\nNon-interventionalism is a core tenant of my political beliefs (left-leaning libertarian) but I break with that belief when it comes to gross human rights violations.  The wars in Iraq/Afghanistan/Vietnam etc. were obvious failures for example, but we have a duty as Americans to support the toppling of the Iranian regime (similarly to why fighting the Nazis was an imperative intervention).  \n\nThey have oppressed the Iranian people since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.  For the moronic liberals who dont seem to care, there are many examples of the persecution the people over there are facing.  For example, gay rights don't exist under the Islamic Republic.  At best gay people are subjected to flogging (100 lashes), imprisonment, and torture.  At its worst, they are subjected to hanging from cranes, lynchings, sexual torture, or forced hormonal and surgical transitions to the opposite sex.  Women are also treated as second class citizens.\n\nIt does make me wonder whether radical leftists are simply ignorant (a common problem), or alternatively, just as insidious as the \"America first\" woke right.  Based on their views on Israel, I'm inclined to believe its the latter.\n\nLet's not forget the additional benefits regarding the fall of the Islamic Republic: if the head of the snake is cut off, the Houthis of Yemen, Hezbollah of Lebanon, Hamas of Gaza, etc. will fall as well without the support of the regime.  There will be an unprecedented shift toward peace and prosperity across the middle east as a whole.\n\nThe Iranian people are taking back their country from the IRGC and Ayatollah Khomeini; it's unbelievably admirable that they are successfully doing it on their own, but we owe them our support.  Jews and Persians have been friends for over 2,700 years. The United States and (especially) Israel have a duty to intervene in Iran and support His Imperial Majesty, the Shahanshah of Iran, Reza Pahlavi and his vow to make Iran a democracy.\n\nAs they say, \"prove me wrong\" in the comments if you'd like to try.  My guess is that the radical leftists and woke right didn't understand most of my post anyway, so you're already at a disadvantage 😉.",

It was kind of maddening, seeing such morally self righteous people support such obviously bigotry and violence.\n\nBut seeing them ignore Iranian protests, and in some cases, actually support the Iranian government, I am realizing that the core of the movement never even thought they cared about oppressed people. 12,000, perhaps 20,000 people killed in a matter of days, by an oppressive government, (and unlike the horrifying events in Sudan and Yemen, FULLY in Western new) and not a peep from them.\n\nI realize now that they knew full well these were just buzzwords they were using because they were having a good time attacking their symbolic villain, the country full of \"what just so happens to be full of Jews, what a weird coincidence, that has nothing to do with my obsession at all even though I only and exclusively obsess over the one Jewish country.\"\n\nI wonder, are Pro-Palestinians on the fringes of the movement who were ignorant about the motives of the core starting to realize that the movement has nothing to do with human rights? Have they started to ask each other \"Wait a minute, why aren't we protesting this?\" Or is their need to please their community so strong, they are simply going to put this out of their minds? Either way, they can't be totally ignorant about it anymore. If they were simply naive in the past, they know better now.\n\nI'm upset that the Iranian people aren't getting more support. But it is something of a relief to know that deep down, Pro-Palestinians know they aren't part of a human rights movement.\n\nNote: Palestinian Pro-Palestinian protesters are an exception to this rule, as fairly pointed out by a Palestinian in another post. They are openly fighting for themselves, not for human rights generally.",

It has influence beyond its borders in neighboring countries with blood or culture ties to Iran. It was once a global power. Even today, it is a major regional power. However, it is not working out very well. \n\nRegime change can change it all. \n\nIranians don’t hate Israel. They aren’t Arab, so they don’t really care. Shiite Islam doesn’t even believe that Jerusalem is the third holiest place. In any case, many Iranians are secular. Many of them are Azeris or Kurds. Indeed, close to a third of Iranian are either Azeri or Kurdish. Azerbaijan is the friendliest Muslim state for Israel. Kurdistan remains unrecognized but it’s also quite friendly to Israel. Secular Persians in the cities are also famously friendly towards Israel. \n\nIran and Israel would be close allies in a normal world. Both have a history of hostility with the neighboring Arabs. Both have been allies in the past actually. They have a shared political interest. There’s a lot of political potential for a new Israeli, Iranian, and Emirati axis. \n\nThis new axis would counteract Turkey, another huge country in the Middle East who’s not Arab. The Turks are trying to take over, but they aren’t that great. Turkey and Qatar support the Muslim brotherhood, an Islamic Sunni movement who remains a fellow jihadi traveler of the Shiite radicals. Realigning the Middle East away from this Turkish Qatari axis towards an Israeli Iranian axis would dramatically change things for the better. \n\nSaudi Arabia would remain stuck between the two sides, struggling to decide whether it wants to become a Turkey (ie a two faced Islamic regime playing a double game) or become something new. So far, we’ve seen a mixed signals from the Saudis. \n\nThe Iranian regime is very weak. It lost all legitimacy. The war with Israel showed its military is a paper tiger unable to defend Iran’s most sensitive military installations from Israeli strikes. Its ballistic missiles have done damage, but only minimal damage. It lost its nuclear program. Its proxies have been severely mutilated. \n\n People smell the weakness because it was laid bare for everyone to see. For decades we’ve been told that Iran is so strong a war with it would cost many lives on the Israeli and American side. We see now that this was just not true. They are in fact very weak. \n\nAnd also very stupid. They have diverted billions from the economy towards a military buildup that proved absolutely useless. Spending so much on such a useless military project is only one of many stupid decisions taken by the evil regime. \n\nThe Middle East and the rest of the world have nothing but good things to gain from the collapse of this regime. It’s the best chance to create real lasting change in the Middle East. \n\n",

Again I ask, how does that make Israel the bad guy?\n\nTo add on, Israel’s ideology is not kill all Palestinians and their civilians, however the power in Palestine (Hamas) wants to kill all Jews and their civilians. In 2005 they give Palestine gaza and what happens? Hamas uses it to build miles of tunnels and send hundreds or thousands of missiles to Israel. On October 7th 3,000 Hamas members come into Israel and burn babies and r**e women. Israel starts bombing Hamas who have built their operations in with the civilians, and civilians die. Is it also true that 90% of deaths in modern urban warfare are civilian deaths, according to Hamas around 80% of deaths in gaza are civilian. A good amount of this was also done by Hamas but they don’t seem to mention that in their numbers, strange right?\n\nIf the leaders of the country next to mine wanted to kill all my civilians then I would take their country to make sure they couldn’t rebuild and try it again.

However, I don’t fall into either the pro Palestinian or pro Israel camp - I can see fault on both sides. Hamas is a terrorist organisation - who wants the destruction of Israel and is prepared to sacrifice their own innocent civilians to achieve this aim. They deliberately committed a heinous act on Israel, not only killing innocent Israeli citizens (and taking them hostage) but also knowing full well the repercussions for their own citizens when Israel retaliated. I believe this was also part of their plan to garnish and manipulate as much anti Israel sentiment in the world as possible. Whereas, Israel as the significantly greater military power has significantly abused this, and is responsible for killing thousands and thousands of innocent people. With their military and security capabilities I am sure they could have secured security for their citizens without the massive loss of lives. \nI believe the only way forward for peace is an end to both extremist views and a pragmatic compromise from both. To reach this both sides need the rest of the world to exert pressure - neither side otherwise has any incentive to stop - Hamas because they don’t seem to care if their citizens are killed and are succeeding in turning the world against Israel and Israel as the more powerful force doesn’t need to compromise. I personally believe that the pro Palestinian and pro Israeli movements are doing more harm than good. Why isn’t there more of a movement persuading both sides to stop the hate and rhetoric - stop campaigning for the end of Israel (never going to happen), stop supporting Hamas but also stop supporting right wing Israeli government who is relentlessly bombin and killing people.",

And there is also a larger irony in that silence that needs to be addressed.\n\nFor the past two years, many of you either defended, justified, or stayed silent about disturbing chants, protests, and violence that Jews were raising concerns about. When Jews spoke up, we were told that calling it out was just a distraction from the larger issue of what was happening in Gaza.\n\nNow, there is a shift.\n\nSuddenly, many of you are drawing lines with 'those people' on the left. You are much more openly distancing yourselves from those *same* people. You are making it clear you do not want to be associated with them.\n\nThis is a normal reaction.  Good for youi. The irony is not that you are doing it. The irony is that you are doing it *now*, after two years of refusing to allow Jews to do the same.\n\nFor two years, the overwhelming majority of Jews, including many of us on the left, have been explicitly saying: We do not support Netanyahu. We do not support settlement expansion or violent settlers. We do not support right wing extremism. We do not support the harm to innocent civilians in Gaza or anywhere.\n\nYet our calls were dismissed anyway. We were told they did not count. We were told they were insincere. We were told that because bad actors existed on our side, we were still responsible for them regardless of what we actually believed or said. Worst of all, we were told we are liars.\n\nI make this point not to claim everyone on the left is the same, or pretending the situations in Gaza and Iran are the same. It's more than that. \n\nIf Jews are not allowed to separate ourselves from the worst elements of our political or zionist identity, then that same logic should apply here, no? You cannot spend two years minimizing the fringes when Jews point them out and telling us we deserve it, and then suddenly insist they are just fringe when they 'don't represent' you.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nFor two years, Jews tried to distance ourselves from extremists and were told it did not count. Now many on the left are doing the same thing with their own fringes who are shockingly silent about what's happening in Iran, exposing the huge hypocrisy and lack of credibility on that side. \n\nHow about we all advocate for the Iranian and Palestinian people and their freedom and against dangerous fringe groups on both sides?",

The pictures from the ground are clear. It is an ideological decision to look the other way when the oppressor is not identified with the West. In fact, the leftists' treatment of the protests in Iran is as a 'struggle over the cost of living.' What a joke.\n\nThis rhymes with Mamdani's recent attempts to block real estate deals of Israeli companies (https://www.jpost.com/real-estate/article-883005) and Bernie Sanders and his ilk's declaration that they want a \"Progressive revolution\" - and you can see the red-green alliance for what it is - almost enemies of humanity. When the left does support the protesters in Iran - they say 'they don't want Israel's support' and try to speak on behalf of the protesters, as befits the left (forget that Netanyahu is currently one of the most popular people among Iranian dissidents). \n\nThey are not really capable of supporting the overthrow of the regime, because then it would mean that Israel was right - it is similar to how they barely supported the overthrow of Maduro, and were mainly busy attacking Trump. Anything that might be good for Israel and the United States - they are automatically against. The goal is always about using \"human rights\" and \"international law\" - trying to limit the US and Israel's fight against terror, in order to help terrorists and third-world regimes and dismantling American/Israel-aligned democratic interests.\n\nIf the Ayatollah falls, it strengthens the strategic position of the United States and Israel. Because the Left’s current \"Progressive\" framework is built on the reflexive opposition to anything beneficial for Israel, they would rather see a murderous Islamic regime remain in power than hand a geopolitical victory to Israel\n\nAt the heart of this silence is a profound disgust with Western liberalism itself. Figures like Mamdani argue that the modern states - particularly the United States and Israel-are a colonial construct that must be \"deconstructed.\" For the radical Left, the goal isn't a Western, stable democracy but to facilitate a \"Progressive Revolution\" that replaces it entirely. They view the Iranian regime not as a theocratic prison, but as a \"sovereign\" counter-weight to Western hegemony. In their worldview, any force that opposes the \"imperialist\" West is a partner in the struggle. \n\nThe Left will support anything that weakens the US and Israel and will try to transform the Western culture from its core to an Islamic-friendly, open borders, anti-Jewish culture and environment.

Due to these constant displacements, we started returning to our homeland after the 1400s (Spanish Inquisition), and the return kept amping up, especially in the 1800s (Russian pogroms) and early 1900s (Holocaust.)\n\nDuring our exiles, Arab Muslim conquered the entire Middle East and Northern Africa. Then Ottoman Turks conquered the area, and then later Britain beat the Ottomans and took over. By the early 1900s, the land was mostly Arab thanks to those earlier Arab conquests — they were a mix of Arabs who had lived there for a long time, and Arabs who had just moved there to work for the British. Similarly, we were a mix of Jews who had been there for a long time, and Jews who had recently arrived. Ottomans/British were the ones actually ruling things though.\n\nHundreds of nationalist movements started springing up during the later 1800s and early 1900s, including Jewish nationalism (Zionism) and Arab nationalism. Jews hoped to self determine in our homeland to finally have agency and safety for the first time in thousands of years. Arabs, meanwhile, sought to re-take over the entire Middle East and Northern Africa. Obviously, the Jewish desire to have 0.1% of the Middle East interfered with the Arab plans to conquer 100% of it.\n\nSo Arabs started massacring Jews in the 1920s to prevent them having control anywhere, and Jews started fighting back in the 1930s, and you end up with ongoing tribal/militant fighting. The British got fed up with the fighting and left. The UN tried to suggest that Jews have about .1% of the Middle East while the Arabs could have 99.9% of it. Jews agreed. Arabs refused and launched a war.\n\nIn that war, which Israelis call the \"War of Independence\" and Arabs call \"The Nakbe\" both sides killed similar numbers of each other (a few thousand). Something like 6 Arab armies marched with their armies to kill and expell all the Jews, and they have far more weapons, technology, and soldiers, but Jews were better organized. Arabs expelled thousands of Jews, and Jews expelled thousands of Arabs. In the end, Jews ended up with roughly the same land that the UN has originally suggested. As revenge, all the Arab countries expelled their 1 million Jews, most of whom went to Israel, and make up the majority of Israelis today.\n\nSince then, Muslims have constantly launched wars to try and conquer Israel, because they find it humiliating that a minority they used to rule over now ruled over them, even if just it .1% of the Middle East. Israel basically reacts to these attacks. Israeli ambitions are basically to continue having their country, and to continue repelling these Muslim attacks.",

They are denounced online as traitors, simps, grifters, Mossad agents etc, do you think thats fair?\n\nTo be transparent: I’m a basically atheist Irish Jew with almost all my immediate and extended family living in Israel for decades now.  My extended family includes a few settlers and some ultra orthodox who don’t recognise the state of Israel (but still gladly hoover up as many benefits as they can), I don’t approve of either group.  My family also includes people who have worked for B’tselem and other human rights groups advocating for Palestinian rights, nieces participated in various peace programs with kids from the other side etc.  All of which is to say I’ve had a decent look at many different groups on the Israeli side and feel I have some understanding of why they think the way they do. \n\nI was living there myself in 1999 when optimism for a 2 state solution was at its peak, at least among Israelis. I visited Ramallah and Jericho a few times back then and I found the similarities between hipsters in Tel Aviv and Ramallah to be really encouraging, like at least on an individual level, maybe we weren’t so different after all.\n\nLike many left leaning Zionists (I think that the term Zionist is kind of redundant at this point but thats a whole other thread), I still dream about peaceful coexistence but it seems like an idle fantasy nowadays. Many of us see the second intifada as having killed the Israeli left and made it impossible to convince most Israelis that it would be safe to give up occupied territory.  For years now, the prevailing view among most Israelis I know, even the pretty liberal ones, is that any territorial concessions will only be used as a springboard for invasions and attacks, 10/7 really reinforced this idea.  While I  feel for the suffering of Palestinians and abhor the current Israeli government, I have to admit that I think this is true, as so much activism in the past 2 years calls for the liberation of all of the ‘48 borders.\n\nAnyway, like many of you on here I’ve been doomscrolling for 2 years solid, and I discovered the three activists mentioned in my title.  I’ll just say what my impressions of them have been and then I’d love to know what you all think, especially those of you who are Palestinian, and whether you’re living in the West Bank/Gaza, Arab citizens of Israel or in the diaspora.\n\nAhmed Al-Khatib:  I find him personally likeable and admire his ability to stay calm in the face of anger and abuse. Also, I often get the sense that he’s telling me what I want to hear and that if he spent a little bit more time focusing on Israel’s misdeeds, then his very legitimate condemnation of Hamas would be more convincing to the wider world.  To be fair, he has called Bibi a war criminal plenty of times and he lost dozens of family members, so he’s got every right to express his views.\n\nSinijlawi:  Similarly to Al-Khatib, I admire his ability to get his message across to Israelis, even those who are quite right wing.  I think on both sides of this conflict, those of us who are sincere about finding a way forward can benefit from his rhetorical approach:  if you start by acknowledging the suffering of the other side, or at least demonstrating that that you understand their position, your audience will be far more willing to listen to you describe your own suffering and your motivations.  Minds can be changed in person, with patience and empathy.\n\nHamza Howidy:  I feel for this guy most of all, he strikes me as the most honest and fearless of the 3.  He doesn’t hold back in his condemnation of Israel (I haven’t always agreed with him on this, but I grew up in freedom and safety), and yet he is relentless in denouncing Hamas for their mistreatment and repression of their own people.  This earns him crazy amounts of hate from white leftists, Palestinians and Muslims in general.  I’m basing that off the comments section on YouTube, Insta etc, so I realise this is not a good or accurate representation of humanity.  The fact that he is genuinely putting his own life in danger to ‘speak truth to power’ I find hugely admirable, and he’s really forced me to confront uncomfortable truths about Israel that I’d rather ignore.\n\nAre there many more people who think as they do, who are scared to speak up for fear of being denounced as traitors?\n\nDo you think that a pragmatic approach, abandoning armed resistance/terrorism (delete as appropriate) could ever actually achieve a sovereign Palestinian state?  Assuming of course that Israelis can be moved back to a position where they are willing to dismantle settlements, share some sovereignty over Jerusalem etc",

    "title": "The Iron Wall Reconsidered: Power, Permanence, and the Absence of Resolution",
    "selftext": "From its earliest intellectual foundations, the Zionist movement grappled with what later became known as the “Palestinian Question.” Among the most influential approaches to this issue was the doctrine articulated by Ze’ev Jabotinsky in his 1923 essay The Iron Wall. Jabotinsky argued that Jewish sovereignty in Palestine could only survive if it were protected by an unassailable “Iron Wall” of military and political strength, one that would make Arab resistance futile. Only after such resistance had been decisively broken, he believed, would the Arab population pragmatically accept the permanence of a Jewish state.\n\nJabotinsky was correct in identifying the necessity of overwhelming Jewish strength for the survival of the Zionist project. History has repeatedly demonstrated that without military superiority and deterrence, the Jewish state would not have endured. However, he erred in his assumption that such strength would eventually compel Arab or Palestinian acceptance of Israel’s permanence, even in a purely pragmatic sense. Instead, decades of conflict suggest that military deterrence, while essential for survival, has failed to produce political reconciliation or genuine compromise.\n\nThis reveals a limitation in the original Iron Wall theory. A more accurate conception of the conflict recognizes that military power can prevent defeat but cannot induce acceptance. The endurance of Palestinian national resistance, despite repeated military losses, demonstrates that deterrence alone does not resolve identity-based, zero-sum national conflicts. Thus, while the Iron Wall remains necessary, it is insufficient as a pathway to peace.\n\nIn contrast, early Labor Zionist thinkers initially pursued a different approach. Prior to David Ben-Gurion’s later embrace of a more explicitly militant and statist posture, Labor Zionism often advanced an economic solution to the Arab–Jewish conflict. This approach held that Jewish-led economic development would benefit the Arab population, reduce hostility, and integrate Arabs into a shared material future. In practice, however, economic development neither neutralized nationalist opposition nor resolved the fundamental political conflict over sovereignty and land.\n\nThe historical record therefore suggests a sobering conclusion: there is no definitive “solution” to the Palestinian Question in the sense envisioned by early Zionist theorists, whether through military deterrence or economic integration. The Iron Wall remains indispensable for ensuring the survival of the Jewish state, but it must be understood as a strategy of endurance rather than resolution. No strategy, military, economic, or diplomatic, has proven capable of producing lasting peace under conditions where both sides assert mutually exclusive national claims.\n\nIn this light, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is best understood not as a solvable dispute awaiting the correct policy, but as a persistent national conflict that can be managed, contained, and mitigated, but not conclusively resolved. The Iron Wall, revised through historical experience, secures survival rather than reconciliation, and peace, if it emerges at all, will be contingent, fragile, and limited rather than final.\n",

They'll scream about freeing Palestine from \"the river to the sea\" (a pejorative term and call for destruction of jews and Israelis by the way), but I only hear radio silence on this issue.\n\nNon-interventionalism is a core tenant of my political beliefs (left-leaning libertarian) but I break with that belief when it comes to gross human rights violations.  The wars in Iraq/Afghanistan/Vietnam etc. were obvious failures for example, but we have a duty as Americans to support the toppling of the Iranian regime (similarly to why fighting the Nazis was an imperative intervention).  \n\nThey have oppressed the Iranian people since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.  For the moronic liberals who dont seem to care, there are many examples of the persecution the people over there are facing.  For example, gay rights don't exist under the Islamic Republic.  At best gay people are subjected to flogging (100 lashes), imprisonment, and torture.  At its worst, they are subjected to hanging from cranes, lynchings, sexual torture, or forced hormonal and surgical transitions to the opposite sex.  Women are also treated as second class citizens.\n\nIt does make me wonder whether radical leftists are simply ignorant (a common problem), or alternatively, just as insidious as the \"America first\" woke right.  Based on their views on Israel, I'm inclined to believe its the latter.\n\nLet's not forget the additional benefits regarding the fall of the Islamic Republic: if the head of the snake is cut off, the Houthis of Yemen, Hezbollah of Lebanon, Hamas of Gaza, etc. will fall as well without the support of the regime.  There will be an unprecedented shift toward peace and prosperity across the middle east as a whole.\n\nThe Iranian people are taking back their country from the IRGC and Ayatollah Khomeini; it's unbelievably admirable that they are successfully doing it on their own, but we owe them our support.  Jews and Persians have been friends for over 2,700 years. The United States and (especially) Israel have a duty to intervene in Iran and support His Imperial Majesty, the Shahanshah of Iran, Reza Pahlavi and his vow to make Iran a democracy.\n\nAs they say, \"prove me wrong\" in the comments if you'd like to try.

It has influence beyond its borders in neighboring countries with blood or culture ties to Iran. It was once a global power. Even today, it is a major regional power. However, it is not working out very well. \n\nRegime change can change it all. \n\nIranians don’t hate Israel. They aren’t Arab, so they don’t really care. Shiite Islam doesn’t even believe that Jerusalem is the third holiest place. In any case, many Iranians are secular. Many of them are Azeris or Kurds. Indeed, close to a third of Iranian are either Azeri or Kurdish. Azerbaijan is the friendliest Muslim state for Israel. Kurdistan remains unrecognized but it’s also quite friendly to Israel. Secular Persians in the cities are also famously friendly towards Israel. \n\nIran and Israel would be close allies in a normal world. Both have a history of hostility with the neighboring Arabs. Both have been allies in the past actually. They have a shared political interest. There’s a lot of political potential for a new Israeli, Iranian, and Emirati axis. \n\nThis new axis would counteract Turkey, another huge country in the Middle East who’s not Arab. The Turks are trying to take over, but they aren’t that great. Turkey and Qatar support the Muslim brotherhood, an Islamic Sunni movement who remains a fellow jihadi traveler of the Shiite radicals. Realigning the Middle East away from this Turkish Qatari axis towards an Israeli Iranian axis would dramatically change things for the better. \n\nSaudi Arabia would remain stuck between the two sides, struggling to decide whether it wants to become a Turkey (ie a two faced Islamic regime playing a double game) or become something new. So far, we’ve seen a mixed signals from the Saudis. \n\nThe Iranian regime is very weak. It lost all legitimacy. The war with Israel showed its military is a paper tiger unable to defend Iran’s most sensitive military installations from Israeli strikes. Its ballistic missiles have done damage, but only minimal damage. It lost its nuclear program. Its proxies have been severely mutilated. \n\n People smell the weakness because it was laid bare for everyone to see. For decades we’ve been told that Iran is so strong a war with it would cost many lives on the Israeli and American side. We see now that this was just not true. They are in fact very weak. \n\nAnd also very stupid. They have diverted billions from the economy towards a military buildup that proved absolutely useless. Spending so much on such a useless military project is only one of many stupid decisions taken by the evil regime. \n\nThe Middle East and the rest of the world have nothing but good things to gain from the collapse of this regime. It’s the best chance to create real lasting change in the Middle East. \n\n",

Again I ask, how does that make Israel the bad guy?\n\nTo add on, Israel’s ideology is not kill all Palestinians and their civilians, however the power in Palestine (Hamas) wants to kill all Jews and their civilians. In 2005 they give Palestine gaza and what happens? Hamas uses it to build miles of tunnels and send hundreds or thousands of missiles to Israel. On October 7th 3,000 Hamas members come into Israel and burn babies and r**e women. Israel starts bombing Hamas who have built their operations in with the civilians, and civilians die. Is it also true that 90% of deaths in modern urban warfare are civilian deaths, according to Hamas around 80% of deaths in gaza are civilian. A good amount of this was also done by Hamas but they don’t seem to mention that in their numbers, strange right?\n\nIf the leaders of the country next to mine wanted to kill all my civilians then I would take their country to make sure they couldn’t rebuild and try it again.

    "selftext": "Like most people I am horrified about what is happening to thousands of innocent people in Gaza. However, I don’t fall into either the pro Palestinian or pro Israel camp - I can see fault on both sides. Hamas is a terrorist organisation - who wants the destruction of Israel and is prepared to sacrifice their own innocent civilians to achieve this aim. They deliberately committed a heinous act on Israel, not only killing innocent Israeli citizens (and taking them hostage) but also knowing full well the repercussions for their own citizens when Israel retaliated. I believe this was also part of their plan to garnish and manipulate as much anti Israel sentiment in the world as possible. Whereas, Israel as the significantly greater military power has significantly abused this, and is responsible for killing thousands and thousands of innocent people. With their military and security capabilities I am sure they could have secured security for their citizens without the massive loss of lives. \nI believe the only way forward for peace is an end to both extremist views and a pragmatic compromise from both. To reach this both sides need the rest of the world to exert pressure - neither side otherwise has any incentive to stop - Hamas because they don’t seem to care if their citizens are killed and are succeeding in turning the world against Israel and Israel as the more powerful force doesn’t need to compromise. I personally believe that the pro Palestinian and pro Israeli movements are doing more harm than good. Why isn’t there more of a movement persuading both sides to stop the hate and rhetoric - stop campaigning for the end of Israel (never going to happen), stop supporting Hamas but also stop supporting right wing Israeli government who is relentlessly bombin and killing people.",

And there is also a larger irony in that silence that needs to be addressed.\n\nFor the past two years, many of you either defended, justified, or stayed silent about disturbing chants, protests, and violence that Jews were raising concerns about. When Jews spoke up, we were told that calling it out was just a distraction from the larger issue of what was happening in Gaza.\n\nNow, there is a shift.\n\nSuddenly, many of you are drawing lines with 'those people' on the left. You are much more openly distancing yourselves from those *same* people. You are making it clear you do not want to be associated with them.\n\nThis is a normal reaction.  Good for youi. The irony is not that you are doing it. The irony is that you are doing it *now*, after two years of refusing to allow Jews to do the same.\n\nFor two years, the overwhelming majority of Jews, including many of us on the left, have been explicitly saying: We do not support Netanyahu. We do not support settlement expansion or violent settlers. We do not support right wing extremism. We do not support the harm to innocent civilians in Gaza or anywhere.\n\nYet our calls were dismissed anyway. We were told they did not count. We were told they were insincere. We were told that because bad actors existed on our side, we were still responsible for them regardless of what we actually believed or said. Worst of all, we were told we are liars.\n\nI make this point not to claim everyone on the left is the same, or pretending the situations in Gaza and Iran are the same. It's more than that. \n\nIf Jews are not allowed to separate ourselves from the worst elements of our political or zionist identity, then that same logic should apply here, no? You cannot spend two years minimizing the fringes when Jews point them out and telling us we deserve it, and then suddenly insist they are just fringe when they 'don't represent' you.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nFor two years, Jews tried to distance ourselves from extremists and were told it did not count. Now many on the left are doing the same thing with their own fringes who are shockingly silent about what's happening in Iran, exposing the huge hypocrisy and lack of credibility on that side. \n\nHow about we all advocate for the Iranian and Palestinian people and their freedom and against dangerous fringe groups on both sides?",

The pictures from the ground are clear. It is an ideological decision to look the other way when the oppressor is not identified with the West. In fact, the leftists' treatment of the protests in Iran is as a 'struggle over the cost of living.' What a joke.\n\nThis rhymes with Mamdani's recent attempts to block real estate deals of Israeli companies (https://www.jpost.com/real-estate/article-883005) and Bernie Sanders and his ilk's declaration that they want a \"Progressive revolution\" - and you can see the red-green alliance for what it is - almost enemies of humanity. When the left does support the protesters in Iran - they say 'they don't want Israel's support' and try to speak on behalf of the protesters, as befits the left (forget that Netanyahu is currently one of the most popular people among Iranian dissidents). \n\nThey are not really capable of supporting the overthrow of the regime, because then it would mean that Israel was right - it is similar to how they barely supported the overthrow of Maduro, and were mainly busy attacking Trump. Anything that might be good for Israel and the United States - they are automatically against. The goal is always about using \"human rights\" and \"international law\" - trying to limit the US and Israel's fight against terror, in order to help terrorists and third-world regimes and dismantling American/Israel-aligned democratic interests.\n\nIf the Ayatollah falls, it strengthens the strategic position of the United States and Israel. Because the Left’s current \"Progressive\" framework is built on the reflexive opposition to anything beneficial for Israel, they would rather see a murderous Islamic regime remain in power than hand a geopolitical victory to Israel\n\nAt the heart of this silence is a profound disgust with Western liberalism itself. Figures like Mamdani argue that the modern states - particularly the United States and Israel-are a colonial construct that must be \"deconstructed.\" For the radical Left, the goal isn't a Western, stable democracy but to facilitate a \"Progressive Revolution\" that replaces it entirely. They view the Iranian regime not as a theocratic prison, but as a \"sovereign\" counter-weight to Western hegemony. In their worldview, any force that opposes the \"imperialist\" West is a partner in the struggle. \n\nThe Left will support anything that weakens the US and Israel and will try to transform the Western culture from its core to an Islamic-friendly, open borders, anti-Jewish culture and environment.

But no, the passion of the marches, the continuous shouts of from the river to the sea… it simply doesn’t carry over to another tragedy. Why can’t I call the Iranian regime genocidal? Where is the Wikipedia page about the 2026 Iranian genocide?\n\nI know there have been plenty of other examples, Syria, Yemen, Sudan.

They consciously shout from the river to the sea or globalize the intifada, and how Israel is a genocidal apartheid state. A tradegy is a tragedy, deaths are deaths, a genocide is a genocide. I guess I’ll be waiting for Wikipedia to catch up, along with plenty of pages regarding the denial or recognition of said genocide. The protesters primary concern was about the casualties. ",

    "selftext": "Jews are from Israel. Most of us were displaced from there and scattered around the world, where we were constantly massacred and displaced, over and over. Due to these constant displacements, we started returning to our homeland after the 1400s (Spanish Inquisition), and the return kept amping up, especially in the 1800s (Russian pogroms) and early 1900s (Holocaust.)\n\nDuring our exiles, Arab Muslim conquered the entire Middle East and Northern Africa. Then Ottoman Turks conquered the area, and then later Britain beat the Ottomans and took over. By the early 1900s, the land was mostly Arab thanks to those earlier Arab conquests — they were a mix of Arabs who had lived there for a long time, and Arabs who had just moved there to work for the British. Similarly, we were a mix of Jews who had been there for a long time, and Jews who had recently arrived. Ottomans/British were the ones actually ruling things though.\n\nHundreds of nationalist movements started springing up during the later 1800s and early 1900s, including Jewish nationalism (Zionism) and Arab nationalism. Jews hoped to self determine in our homeland to finally have agency and safety for the first time in thousands of years. Arabs, meanwhile, sought to re-take over the entire Middle East and Northern Africa. Obviously, the Jewish desire to have 0.1% of the Middle East interfered with the Arab plans to conquer 100% of it.\n\nSo Arabs started massacring Jews in the 1920s to prevent them having control anywhere, and Jews started fighting back in the 1930s, and you end up with ongoing tribal/militant fighting. The British got fed up with the fighting and left. The UN tried to suggest that Jews have about .1% of the Middle East while the Arabs could have 99.9% of it. Jews agreed. Arabs refused and launched a war.\n\nIn that war, which Israelis call the \"War of Independence\" and Arabs call \"The Nakbe\" both sides killed similar numbers of each other (a few thousand). Something like 6 Arab armies marched with their armies to kill and expell all the Jews, and they have far more weapons, technology, and soldiers, but Jews were better organized. Arabs expelled thousands of Jews, and Jews expelled thousands of Arabs. In the end, Jews ended up with roughly the same land that the UN has originally suggested. As revenge, all the Arab countries expelled their 1 million Jews, most of whom went to Israel, and make up the majority of Israelis today.\n\nSince then, Muslims have constantly launched wars to try and conquer Israel, because they find it humiliating that a minority they used to rule over now ruled over them, even if just it .1% of the Middle East. Israel basically reacts to these attacks. Israeli ambitions are basically to continue having their country, and to continue repelling these Muslim attacks.",

They are denounced online as traitors, simps, grifters, Mossad agents etc, do you think thats fair?\n\nTo be transparent: I’m a basically atheist Irish Jew with almost all my immediate and extended family living in Israel for decades now.  My extended family includes a few settlers and some ultra orthodox who don’t recognise the state of Israel (but still gladly hoover up as many benefits as they can), I don’t approve of either group.  My family also includes people who have worked for B’tselem and other human rights groups advocating for Palestinian rights, nieces participated in various peace programs with kids from the other side etc.  All of which is to say I’ve had a decent look at many different groups on the Israeli side and feel I have some understanding of why they think the way they do. \n\nI was living there myself in 1999 when optimism for a 2 state solution was at its peak, at least among Israelis. I visited Ramallah and Jericho a few times back then and I found the similarities between hipsters in Tel Aviv and Ramallah to be really encouraging, like at least on an individual level, maybe we weren’t so different after all.\n\nLike many left leaning Zionists (I think that the term Zionist is kind of redundant at this point but thats a whole other thread), I still dream about peaceful coexistence but it seems like an idle fantasy nowadays. Many of us see the second intifada as having killed the Israeli left and made it impossible to convince most Israelis that it would be safe to give up occupied territory.  For years now, the prevailing view among most Israelis I know, even the pretty liberal ones, is that any territorial concessions will only be used as a springboard for invasions and attacks, 10/7 really reinforced this idea.  While I  feel for the suffering of Palestinians and abhor the current Israeli government, I have to admit that I think this is true, as so much activism in the past 2 years calls for the liberation of all of the ‘48 borders.\n\nAnyway, like many of you on here I’ve been doomscrolling for 2 years solid, and I discovered the three activists mentioned in my title.  I’ll just say what my impressions of them have been and then I’d love to know what you all think, especially those of you who are Palestinian, and whether you’re living in the West Bank/Gaza, Arab citizens of Israel or in the diaspora.\n\nAhmed Al-Khatib:  I find him personally likeable and admire his ability to stay calm in the face of anger and abuse. Also, I often get the sense that he’s telling me what I want to hear and that if he spent a little bit more time focusing on Israel’s misdeeds, then his very legitimate condemnation of Hamas would be more convincing to the wider world.  To be fair, he has called Bibi a war criminal plenty of times and he lost dozens of family members, so he’s got every right to express his views.\n\nSinijlawi:  Similarly to Al-Khatib, I admire his ability to get his message across to Israelis, even those who are quite right wing.  I think on both sides of this conflict, those of us who are sincere about finding a way forward can benefit from his rhetorical approach:  if you start by acknowledging the suffering of the other side, or at least demonstrating that that you understand their position, your audience will be far more willing to listen to you describe your own suffering and your motivations.  Minds can be changed in person, with patience and empathy.\n\nHamza Howidy:  I feel for this guy most of all, he strikes me as the most honest and fearless of the 3.  He doesn’t hold back in his condemnation of Israel (I haven’t always agreed with him on this, but I grew up in freedom and safety), and yet he is relentless in denouncing Hamas for their mistreatment and repression of their own people.  This earns him crazy amounts of hate from white leftists, Palestinians and Muslims in general.  I’m basing that off the comments section on YouTube, Insta etc, so I realise this is not a good or accurate representation of humanity.  The fact that he is genuinely putting his own life in danger to ‘speak truth to power’ I find hugely admirable, and he’s really forced me to confront uncomfortable truths about Israel that I’d rather ignore.\n\nAre there many more people who think as they do, who are scared to speak up for fear of being denounced as traitors?\n\nDo you think that a pragmatic approach, abandoning armed resistance/terrorism (delete as appropriate) could ever actually achieve a sovereign Palestinian state?  Assuming of course that Israelis can be moved back to a position where they are willing to dismantle settlements, share some sovereignty over Jerusalem etc",

    "title": "The Iron Wall Reconsidered: Power, Permanence, and the Absence of Resolution",
    "selftext": "From its earliest intellectual foundations, the Zionist movement grappled with what later became known as the “Palestinian Question.” Among the most influential approaches to this issue was the doctrine articulated by Ze’ev Jabotinsky in his 1923 essay The Iron Wall. Jabotinsky argued that Jewish sovereignty in Palestine could only survive if it were protected by an unassailable “Iron Wall” of military and political strength, one that would make Arab resistance futile. Only after such resistance had been decisively broken, he believed, would the Arab population pragmatically accept the permanence of a Jewish state.\n\nJabotinsky was correct in identifying the necessity of overwhelming Jewish strength for the survival of the Zionist project. History has repeatedly demonstrated that without military superiority and deterrence, the Jewish state would not have endured. However, he erred in his assumption that such strength would eventually compel Arab or Palestinian acceptance of Israel’s permanence, even in a purely pragmatic sense. Instead, decades of conflict suggest that military deterrence, while essential for survival, has failed to produce political reconciliation or genuine compromise.\n\nThis reveals a limitation in the original Iron Wall theory. A more accurate conception of the conflict recognizes that military power can prevent defeat but cannot induce acceptance. The endurance of Palestinian national resistance, despite repeated military losses, demonstrates that deterrence alone does not resolve identity-based, zero-sum national conflicts. Thus, while the Iron Wall remains necessary, it is insufficient as a pathway to peace.\n\nIn contrast, early Labor Zionist thinkers initially pursued a different approach. Prior to David Ben-Gurion’s later embrace of a more explicitly militant and statist posture, Labor Zionism often advanced an economic solution to the Arab–Jewish conflict. This approach held that Jewish-led economic development would benefit the Arab population, reduce hostility, and integrate Arabs into a shared material future. In practice, however, economic development neither neutralized nationalist opposition nor resolved the fundamental political conflict over sovereignty and land.\n\nThe historical record therefore suggests a sobering conclusion: there is no definitive “solution” to the Palestinian Question in the sense envisioned by early Zionist theorists, whether through military deterrence or economic integration. The Iron Wall remains indispensable for ensuring the survival of the Jewish state, but it must be understood as a strategy of endurance rather than resolution. No strategy, military, economic, or diplomatic, has proven capable of producing lasting peace under conditions where both sides assert mutually exclusive national claims.\n\nIn this light, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is best understood not as a solvable dispute awaiting the correct policy, but as a persistent national conflict that can be managed, contained, and mitigated, but not conclusively resolved. The Iron Wall, revised through historical experience, secures survival rather than reconciliation, and peace, if it emerges at all, will be contingent, fragile, and limited rather than final.\n",

    "selftext": "Mahmoud Al-Ardah: Hero of the \"Freedom Tunnel\" Operation\n\nMahmoud comes from a family of activists.\n\nHis brother Ahmed spent 21 years in prison, his brother Raddad was imprisoned for 19 years, while his brother Shaddad spent several years in detention. His sister Huda, a freed prisoner, lives in Gaza. Their mother says that their home served as a shelter and refuge for Palestinian resistance fighters during the First Intifada.\n\nAl-Ardah was first arrested in 1991, while still young, for participating in the Intifada, and was sentenced to four years in prison. He was released at the end of 1994, after serving 44 months in Israeli detention. Despite his imprisonment, he did not abandon his resistance path, joining the Islamic Jihad Movement and carrying out several attacks against Israeli soldiers and settlers. This led to his re-arrest in 1996 and a sentence of life imprisonment plus 15 years.\n\nIn 2014, Mahmoud attempted to escape twice while imprisoned in \"Shatta\" Prison, but both attempts were discovered, and he was punished with solitary confinement for over a year.\n\nThe \"Great Escape\" from Gilboa Prison in northern occupied Palestine took place on 6 September 2021, carried out by Mahmoud Al-Ardah and five of his comrades. Gilboa Prison, from which they escaped, is considered one of the most secure facilities and is referred to by the Israeli police as \"the vault\" due to its extensive physical and electronic security.\n\nIn this complex operation, the prisoners used simple metal tools to dig a hole in the floor of their cell, which led to a cavity beneath the prison between the concrete foundation columns. They continued digging horizontally until they passed through the thick prison wall, reaching a dirt road outside the prison fence near one of the watchtowers.\n\nThe Israeli police only discovered the escape after settlers who had occupied Palestinian lands reported seeing strangers in the nearby fields. Following this, the police and Israeli border guards launched intensive search operations to capture them.\n\nAfter his re-arrest on 10 September 2021, Mahmoud Al-Ardah was subjected to the harshest forms of abuse, humiliation, and torture. Investigators sought to break him both physically and psychologically to extract confessions about the escape and those who had planned it.\n\nAl-Ardah said: \"We wanted to tell the world that this monster is an illusion made of dust.\"\nHe added: \"I am proud of what I have done because I am human, and a human without freedom is not human. I am under occupation, and it is my right to be free by any means. You occupy our land and our holy sites, and it is our right as a people to be free.\"\nHis sentencing hearing was held on 22 May 2022, and Mahmoud Al-Ardah was sentenced to an additional five years, to be added to the 99 years he had already been sentenced to.\n\nThis hearing took place 11 days after the assassination of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh by Israeli army fire.\n\nThus, the hero Mahmoud Al-Ardah spent more than 30 years in Israeli occupation prisons before being released in the most recent\nprisoner exchange and transferred to Egypt. Mahmoud will hold his wedding next Tuesday, after all he has endured and the sacrifices he has made.\n\nhttps://www.ajnet.me/encyclopedia/2023/11/30/%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a3%d8%b3%d9%8a%d8%b1-%d9%85%d8%ad%d9%85%d9%88%d8%af-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b9%d8%a7%d8%b1%d8%b6%d8%a9-%d9%82%d8%a7%d8%a6%d8%af-%d8%b9%d9%85%d9%84%d9%8a%d8%a9",

No one is illegal on stolen land. They didn't cross the border, the border crossed them.\\*\\*\n\nNow that we've gotten all of that out of the way. I've been struggling with some conflicting feelings. I firmly believe what ICE is doing is akin to what the Nazis did in Europe. It was never about deporting \"criminals\". It's always about racial profiling and blaming immigrants for the country's problems created by the wealthy.\n\nBut I honestly feel mad and conflicted at times. All these people who are showing up for protests and running interference in ICE activity, so many of them stayed silent over the past 2 and a half years of genocide. Why is kidnapping wrong but genocide forgivable to them? It genuinely makes me so mad. Even with all the people showing up for Palestine, it isn't nearly the amount showing up in collective action for immigrants. \n\nI believe both are human rights issues. But I'm really so mad. Genocide is wrong. That isn't a debatable fact. Why didn't all of these people at least speak up about Palestine? Why aren't they continuing to? \n\nBefore people say, we have bigger issues here to deal with, OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE GOING TOWARDS GENOCIDE INSTEAD OF HELPING PEOPLE HERE IN NEED. It IS an American issue that needs to be addressed! No human rights cause is greater than another. All of them equally deserve our attention and voice. Every time I see another person standing up to ice, I see the faces of little Palestinian children crying and begging for mercy\n\nIt almost makes me wonder if the zionist democrats let the ICE issues get worse so they can distract from the Free Palestine movement\n\nAt the end of the day, if you don't stand firmly against genocide, that's all I need to know",

    "title": "Albert Einstein - a Zionist Activist",
    "selftext": "Albert Einstein the Zionist\n\nAlbert Einstein was a Zionist. A German Jew who was ejected from Germany by the Nazis, Einstein viewed the founding of the state of Israel as a very good thing. He was a sort of a Zionist lobbyist. \n\nIndeed, Einstein lobbied for the creation of the state, as proposed in the UN General Assembly partition plan of 1947. The Arabs of course rejected the plan. Einstein passionately endorsed partition. \n\nIn the months preceding the vote for partition, Einstein wrote a letter to India’s prime minister, pleading for India to vote for partition. Einstein is often described as an “anti Zionist,” but some of the things written by him to the Indian leader would be considered “far right” by today’s leftists.\n\nIn the letter, Einstein essentially says - there is no Palestinian people. They’re part of an Arab nation. The Arabs have many lands. The Jews just want a tiny piece of the land. \n\nHe wrote to India’s prime minister\n\n “At the close of world war 1, 99% of the vast, underpopulated territories liberated from the Turks by the Allies were set aside for the national aspirations of the Arabs. Five independent Arab states have since been established in these territories.Only 1% was reserved for the Jewish people in the land of their origin. The decision which led to the proclamation of the Balfour Declaration was not arbitrary, nor the choice of territory capricious. It took into account the needs and aspirations of both Arab and Jew, and certainly, the lion’s share did not fall to the Jews. In the august scale of justice,which weighs need against need, there is not doubt as to whose is more heavy.  The “small notch” in the land of their fathers, granted the Jewish people, somewhat redresses the balance.” \n\nEinstein endorses the Balfour Declaration, universally viewed by radical leftists as evil, while saying “the Arabs have many states and they’re vast. The Jews only want one state in their ancient homeland”. \nSource: \nhttps://hvk.org/2017/0717/18.html \n\nEinstein’s Zionist lobbying continued after the founding of the state. In the 1950s, Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben Gurion, offered Einstein to become Israel’s president. Ben Gurion and Einstein were quite close. Both were Zionist and both were socialists. While Einstein was more socialistic than Ben Gurion, Ben Gurion were unironically socialist (Ben Gurion actually visited the Soviet Union once and spoke highly of Lenin. Ben Gurion later claimed his wife, Paula Ben Gurion, had a crush of Leon Trotsky when she was a young Jewish anarchist in New York City). \n\nBen Gurion would not have offered the presidency to a man who he didn’t think with a 100% certainty was not worthy of it as a Zionist. \n\nEinstein politely declined. “I’m a scientist, not a politician,” he told Ben Gurion. \n\nNevertheless, Einstein’s Zionist activism continued. In 1955, he was slated to read a speech on the radio in favor of Israel.\n\nThe speech was written by no other than Abba Eben, one of Israel’s most prominent diplomats. The speech condemned Arab hostility towards Israel. It drew a direct line between the Holocaust and Arab states’ aggression towards the Jewish state. A speech written by Abba Eben, this was an unmistakably Zionist speech. \n\nThe speech said: \n\n“The establishment of this State was internationally approved and recognised largely for the purpose of rescuing the remnant of the Jewish people from unspeakable horrors of persecution and oppression .  . Thus, the establishment of Israel is an event which actively engages the conscience of this generation,” he continued. “It is, therefore, a bitter paradox to find that a State which was destined to be a shelter for a martyred people is itself threatened by grave dangers to its own security. The universal conscience cannot be indifferent to such peril” \n\nEinstein strongly condemned Israel’s critics: “It is anomalous that world opinion should only criticize Israel’s response to hostility and should not actively seek to bring an end to the Arab hostility which is the root cause of the tension” \n\nSource \n\nhttps://www.algemeiner.com/2013/04/17/einsteins-never-before-seen-israel-independence-day-speech-revealed/\n\nEinstein died before making the address. After his death, he donated his writings to the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where his personal files are still stored. To commemorate Einstein’s life and contributions to the Jewish state, Israel printed his image on the 5 Israeli pound bill (Israel’s currency before the shekel was called Israeli pound). \n\n\nSource \nhttps://www.globecoins.com/שטר-5-לירות-1968-איינשטיין-בנק-ישראל\n\n\nSo there you have it - Albert Einstein, a friend of Israel. Next time you read some propaganda piece about Einstein and Zionism, keep this all in mind. When you know the facts, propaganda loses its power. \n\n\n",

That was the reason given for the party’s reason to withdraw from the Arab Higher Committee, which were strictly opposed to partition. No Arabs came forward to submit evidence, though king Abdullah of Transjordan wrote to Woodhead giving support for partition as well as receiving the Commission in Amman. Assassination attempts against opposition leaders may have well frightened the Nashashibis too. Even in the Peel plan, it highly doubted that 200,000 Arabs could be moved to the Southern part of the Mandate. They suggested a voluntary movement by promising new opportunities. \n\nThe Woodhead Commission considered three different plans, one of which was based on the Peel plan. Reporting in 1938, the Woodhead Commission rejected the Peel plan primarily on the grounds that it could not be implemented without a massive, forced transfer of Arabs (an option that the British government had already ruled out). Had the Mufti favored the partition, the British would have preferred his rule over Abdullah. In Lebanon the Maronites initially also welcomed a Jewish state, which would break the hostile ring of Muslim Arabs. Ben Gurion thought that had the partition plan been carried out, the Holocaust could have had a different effect. If the British fully endorsed and promoted the plan, it could have been implemented with the support of the local Zionists and Arab armies forces in favor. For 1948, there was indication of certain leaders and institutions willing to cooperate with the UNCOP, however the Arab Higher Committee policy silenced any opposition. \n\nLet's start: \n\n\" I don’t understand your optimism...why would Arabs make peace? If I were an Arab leader, I would never sign an agreement with Israel. It is normal; we have taken their country. It is true God promised it to us, but how could that interest them? Our God is not theirs. There has been antisemitism, the Nazis, Hitler, Auschwitz, but was that their fault? They see but one thing: we have come and we have stolen their country. Why would they accept that?\"\n\nWe actually don’t even know if this quote is real. It’s attributed to Nahum Goldmann, who alleged Ben Gurion said this to him in his book Le Paraddoxe Juif in a private conversation. Ben Gurion was describing the Arab perspective of the conflict; he was not suggesting that he believed those things himself. In fact, Goldmann described Ben Gurion as pessimistic about the prospects for peace specifically because the Arab countries had this opinion of the Jewish state.\n\n\"Let us not ignore the truth among ourselves ... politically we are the aggressors and they defend themselves... The country is theirs, because they inhabit it, whereas we want to come here and settle down, and in their view we want to take away from them their country.\"\n\nThis quote explains the same thing. Ben Gurion definitely understood the Arab world's logic for their disapproval of Israel, but no Zionists ever took it seriously. \n\n\" I saw in the Peel Plan two positive things: the ideas of a state and compulsory transfer... I support compulsory transfer. I don't see in it anything immoral, but compulsory transfer can only be affected by England and not by the Jews... Not only is it inconceivable for us to carry it out, but it is also inconceivable for us to propose it.\"\n\nThe Woodhead Commission in 1938 noted that:\n\n\" On behalf of the Jews it was made clear to us that Jewish opinion was opposed to the exercise of any degree of compulsion.\"\n\nHe restates what he means in his letter to Amos in 1937:\n\n\" When I weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the committee's plan against my plan, I find it overall better. In two major things, whose value cannot be estimated, the committee's proposal excels: a. Handing over the entire Galilee to the Jews and placing our northern border on the Lebanon border. This neighborhood has immense political value, because Lebanon and the Jews are both interested in this neighborhood. The Christians in Lebanon can hardly exist without a Jewish state next to them, and we too are interested in an alliance with Christian Lebanon. b. The proposal of the transfer (relocation) of the Arabs from our valleys. We cannot and are not entitled to propose such a thing, because we never wanted to dispossess the Arabs. But since England is handing over a part of the land, which was promised to us, to an Arab state, it is only fair that the Arabs in our state be transferred to the Arab part.\"\n\n\"The Arabs will have to go, but one needs an opportune moment for making it happen, such as a war.\"\n\nThe reason for the strange internal quotations is likely because this quote is a fabrication. Pappe's quote appears absolutely nowhere, and Ben-Gurion does not say a war is \"necessary\" to expel the Arabs, nor does he mention a war in that sentence or the ones before or after; the quote in fuller context is that, after discussing a hypothetical where the Arab world refuses to allow a Jewish state to be populated by Jews. \n\n\" All of our ambitions are built on the assumption that has proven true throughout all of our activities in the land \\[of Israel\\] — that there is enough room for us and for the Arabs in the land \\[of Israel\\]. And if we will have to use force, not for the sake of evicting the Arabs of the Negev or Transjordan, but rather in order to secure the right that belongs to us to settle there, force will be available to us...We do not want to and we do not have to expel Arabs and take their place.\"\n\nThis fake quotation is a paraphrase by Israeli anti-Zionist Ilan Pappé, which was published in the Journal of Palestine Studies, and attributed to a 1937 letter that Ben Gurion wrote his son.\n\n\"The starting point for a solution of the question of the Arabs in the Jewish State is, in his view, the need to prepare the ground for an Arab—Jewish agreement; he supports \\[the establishment of\\] the Jewish State \\[on a small part of Palestine\\], not because he is satisfied with part of the country, but on the basis of the assumption that after we constitute a large force following the establishment of the state — we will cancel the partition \\[of the country between Jews and Arabs\\] and we will expand throughout the Land of Israel.\n\nMr. Shapira \\[a JAE member\\]: \" By force as well?\"\n\nMr. Ben-Gurion: \" \\[No\\]. Through mutual understanding and Jewish-Arab agreement.\"\n\nThis full quote can be found in Efraim Karsh's \"Falsifying the Record\". The idea was to expand land and the state throughout Palestine by working with the Arabs, not by rejecting partition or using it as a foot in the door.\n\n\" If I knew that it would be possible to save all the children in Germany by transporting them to England, and only half by transporting them to the Land of Israel, then I would opt for the second alternative. For we must weigh not only the life of these children, but also the history of the People of Israel.\"\n\nThis is very well used, so to clear it up, in this context, he's talking about Kristallnacht, during debates within the Zionist movement about how to respond to the growing Nazi threat. If all the Jews were to be taken to Britain, then there is a high chance Jews would have all be murdered because if you know history, Germany was very close to invading England, and Jews were dying in the masses. He was thinking about a permanent solution where Jews can still live.\n\n\" The acceptance of partition does not commit us to renounce Transjordan: one does not demand from anybody to give up his vision. We shall accept a state in the boundaries fixed today, but the boundaries of Zionist aspirations are the concern of the Jewish people, and no external factor will be able to limit them.\"\n\nThis quote, too, is addressed by the above clarification of Ben-Gurion's beliefs. As Karsh talks about with reference to the letter Ben-Gurion sent to his son Amos, which is frequently cited but not actually examined in totality. And again, we are still suffering from opinions made 10 years prior, before the Holocaust and WWII and the like. These things could easily have shifted Ben-Gurion's opinion, especially as he said in 1947:\n\n\" Chairman: \"Do you give preference to a federal State or a partition scheme?\"\n\nBen Gurion: \"We want to have a State of our own, and that State can be federate if the other State or States is or are willing to do so in the mutual interest, on condition that our State is in its own right a Member of the United Nations.\"\n\nNote that he accepts another state in this discussion, indicating favor towards partition and possible federation (i.e. the economic union proposed in UNSCOP). He also says later in his testimony: \n\n\" I will tell you what we told the Government last year and this year while we believe and request that our right, at least to the Western part of Palestine should be granted in full and Western Palestine be made a Jewish State, we believe it is possible. We have a right to it, but we are willing to consider an offer of a Jewish State in an area which means less than the whole of Palestine. We will consider it.\"\n\nNow, note that Ben-Gurion is one of the most prominent leaders in history, but the second-most prominent is not Menachem Begin. It was not Begin who was testifying in front of UNSCOP, it was Chaim Weizmann, who would become the first President of Israel. Weizmann is mentioned by Ben-Gurion in that same testimony.\n\n\" Dr. Weizmann is thought so well of by the Jewish people and occupies such a place in our history and among us that he is entitled to speak for himself without any public mandate.\"\n\nNow, Weizmann is recognized as instrumental in the creation of the Jewish state: he was influential with the United States, well-loved by Jews 'round the world, and a huge leader. The reason Ben-Gurion eclipses him is partially because of Ben-Gurion's leadership of the Histadrut and election as Prime Minister, and partially because Ben-Gurion stayed prominent in politics for a very, very long time, steering the country through everything from the Suez Crisis to the acquisition of arms from the French that helped Israel win in 1967, and he was prominent in commanding forces during the 1948 war. Weizmann was a diplomat and politician but spoke for far more of the Jewish populace than begin. And Weizmann was far more fervent about partition than Ben-Gurion even, as noted by the committee members themselves, who said:\n\n\" I presume that Ben-Gurion has listened to the statement of Dr. Weizmann, which was acknowledged with enthusiastic applause by the public. This statement favors a partition of Palestine into two states.\"\n\nFive days after the UN resolution, on December 3, 1947, Ben-Gurion said in a speech:\n\n\" In our state, there will be non-Jews as well, and all of them will be equal citizens, equal in everything without exception. That is, the state will be their state as well.” Ben-Gurion also called for the implementation of the partition in 1947.\"\n\nHowever, in May 1948, Ben-Gurion rightfully said:\n\n\" We accepted the UN partition, but the Arabs did not. They are preparing to make war on us. If we defeat them and capture western Galilee or territory on both sides of the road to Jerusalem, these areas will become part of the state. Why should we obligate ourselves to accept boundaries that the Arabs don’t accept?\"\n\nConclusion:\n\nThere is no doubt that Zionist leaders were clearly interested in getting more land in the partition. However, they have never stated to conquer the entire Middle East, or Palestine. In their defense, countries, like Britain, promised the Mandate to be a Jewish National Homeland (with continuous Jewish immigration). After the 1929 and 1936, there was shift in British policy, and would later battle the Zionists. \n\nI think it would be hypocritical to not mention Arab leader's ambitions to be the King of Syria like King Abdullah. At the end of the day, he still negotiated with the Jews to not participate in the 48 war (in military terms, not policy). I think if Arab leaders showed interest in negotiating, Zionists would have agreed. The idea that they would still expelled/invaded Arabs with both sides agreeing to peace is just Arab fantasy land. \n\nThough, people like Begin didn't like the partition, because he was a revisionist Zionist, who wanted Jordan to be a Jewish state. However, he was involved with a terrorist group that was hunted by the Hagenah and British. I'm going to be making a post about Britain as well, and their policies. There are a million quotes out there, so comment any I could review! I just wanted to post some about the partition specifically. \n\n",

    "title": "Albert Einstein - a Zionist Activist",
    "selftext": "Albert Einstein the Zionist\n\nAlbert Einstein was a Zionist. A German Jew who was ejected from Germany by the Nazis, Einstein viewed the founding of the state of Israel as a very good thing. He was a sort of a Zionist lobbyist. \n\nIndeed, Einstein lobbied for the creation of the state, as proposed in the UN General Assembly partition plan of 1947. The Arabs of course rejected the plan. Einstein passionately endorsed partition. \n\nIn the months preceding the vote for partition, Einstein wrote a letter to India’s prime minister, pleading for India to vote for partition. Einstein is often described as an “anti Zionist,” but some of the things written by him to the Indian leader would be considered “far right” by today’s leftists.\n\nIn the letter, Einstein essentially says - there is no Palestinian people. They’re part of an Arab nation. The Arabs have many lands. The Jews just want a tiny piece of the land. \n\nHe wrote to India’s prime minister\n\n “At the close of world war 1, 99% of the vast, underpopulated territories liberated from the Turks by the Allies were set aside for the national aspirations of the Arabs. Five independent Arab states have since been established in these territories.Only 1% was reserved for the Jewish people in the land of their origin. The decision which led to the proclamation of the Balfour Declaration was not arbitrary, nor the choice of territory capricious. It took into account the needs and aspirations of both Arab and Jew, and certainly, the lion’s share did not fall to the Jews. In the august scale of justice,which weighs need against need, there is not doubt as to whose is more heavy.  The “small notch” in the land of their fathers, granted the Jewish people, somewhat redresses the balance.” \n\nEinstein endorses the Balfour Declaration, universally viewed by radical leftists as evil, while saying “the Arabs have many states and they’re vast. The Jews only want one state in their ancient homeland”. \nSource: \nhttps://hvk.org/2017/0717/18.html \n\nEinstein’s Zionist lobbying continued after the founding of the state. In the 1950s, Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben Gurion, offered Einstein to become Israel’s president. Ben Gurion and Einstein were quite close. Both were Zionist and both were socialists. While Einstein was more socialistic than Ben Gurion, Ben Gurion were unironically socialist (Ben Gurion actually visited the Soviet Union once and spoke highly of Lenin. Ben Gurion later claimed his wife, Paula Ben Gurion, had a crush of Leon Trotsky when she was a young Jewish anarchist in New York City). \n\nBen Gurion would not have offered the presidency to a man who he didn’t think with a 100% certainty was not worthy of it as a Zionist. \n\nEinstein politely declined. “I’m a scientist, not a politician,” he told Ben Gurion. \n\nNevertheless, Einstein’s Zionist activism continued. In 1955, he was slated to read a speech on the radio in favor of Israel.\n\nThe speech was written by no other than Abba Eben, one of Israel’s most prominent diplomats. The speech condemned Arab hostility towards Israel. It drew a direct line between the Holocaust and Arab states’ aggression towards the Jewish state. A speech written by Abba Eben, this was an unmistakably Zionist speech. \n\nThe speech said: \n\n“The establishment of this State was internationally approved and recognised largely for the purpose of rescuing the remnant of the Jewish people from unspeakable horrors of persecution and oppression .  . Thus, the establishment of Israel is an event which actively engages the conscience of this generation,” he continued. “It is, therefore, a bitter paradox to find that a State which was destined to be a shelter for a martyred people is itself threatened by grave dangers to its own security. The universal conscience cannot be indifferent to such peril” \n\nEinstein strongly condemned Israel’s critics: “It is anomalous that world opinion should only criticize Israel’s response to hostility and should not actively seek to bring an end to the Arab hostility which is the root cause of the tension” \n\nSource \n\nhttps://www.algemeiner.com/2013/04/17/einsteins-never-before-seen-israel-independence-day-speech-revealed/\n\nEinstein died before making the address. After his death, he donated his writings to the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where his personal files are still stored. To commemorate Einstein’s life and contributions to the Jewish state, Israel printed his image on the 5 Israeli pound bill (Israel’s currency before the shekel was called Israeli pound). \n\n\nSource \nhttps://www.globecoins.com/שטר-5-לירות-1968-איינשטיין-בנק-ישראל\n\n\nSo there you have it - Albert Einstein, a friend of Israel. Next time you read some propaganda piece about Einstein and Zionism, keep this all in mind. When you know the facts, propaganda loses its power. \n\n\n",

    "title": "Mythbusting: Zionist leaders were \"expansionist\" and wanted to expand borders.",
    "selftext": "Many Pro-Palestinians have to face the reality that Jews really did want peace and were fine with partition. To contradict this well-founded fact, they have to spout out random quotes, and maybe some of the most idiotic contradictions. There are a bunch of quotes from the Israeli side, but I need to clear these up because they are the easiest copy and paste. \n\n1937 Peel Commission\n\nFollowing the publication, in 1938 the Woodhead Commission was appointed to examine it in detail and recommend an actual partition plan. The Jewish Agency accepted the idea of partition, however, didn’t agree with the borders or transfer. Prior to the report’s publication, there was indication that the Nashashibis, backed by Jordan’s Amir Abdullah, were in favor of partition. That was the reason given for the party’s reason to withdraw from the Arab Higher Committee, which were strictly opposed to partition. No Arabs came forward to submit evidence, though king Abdullah of Transjordan wrote to Woodhead giving support for partition as well as receiving the Commission in Amman. Assassination attempts against opposition leaders may have well frightened the Nashashibis too. Even in the Peel plan, it highly doubted that 200,000 Arabs could be moved to the Southern part of the Mandate. They suggested a voluntary movement by promising new opportunities. \n\nThe Woodhead Commission considered three different plans, one of which was based on the Peel plan. Reporting in 1938, the Woodhead Commission rejected the Peel plan primarily on the grounds that it could not be implemented without a massive, forced transfer of Arabs (an option that the British government had already ruled out). Had the Mufti favored the partition, the British would have preferred his rule over Abdullah. In Lebanon the Maronites initially also welcomed a Jewish state, which would break the hostile ring of Muslim Arabs. Ben Gurion thought that had the partition plan been carried out, the Holocaust could have had a different effect. If the British fully endorsed and promoted the plan, it could have been implemented with the support of the local Zionists and Arab armies forces in favor. For 1948, there was indication of certain leaders and institutions willing to cooperate with the UNCOP, however the Arab Higher Committee policy silenced any opposition. \n\nLet's start: \n\n\" I don’t understand your optimism...why would Arabs make peace? If I were an Arab leader, I would never sign an agreement with Israel. It is normal; we have taken their country. It is true God promised it to us, but how could that interest them? Our God is not theirs. There has been antisemitism, the Nazis, Hitler, Auschwitz, but was that their fault? They see but one thing: we have come and we have stolen their country. Why would they accept that?\"\n\nWe actually don’t even know if this quote is real. It’s attributed to Nahum Goldmann, who alleged Ben Gurion said this to him in his book Le Paraddoxe Juif in a private conversation. Ben Gurion was describing the Arab perspective of the conflict; he was not suggesting that he believed those things himself. In fact, Goldmann described Ben Gurion as pessimistic about the prospects for peace specifically because the Arab countries had this opinion of the Jewish state.\n\n\"Let us not ignore the truth among ourselves ... politically we are the aggressors and they defend themselves... The country is theirs, because they inhabit it, whereas we want to come here and settle down, and in their view we want to take away from them their country.\"\n\nThis quote explains the same thing. Ben Gurion definitely understood the Arab world's logic for their disapproval of Israel, but no Zionists ever took it seriously. \n\n\" I saw in the Peel Plan two positive things: the ideas of a state and compulsory transfer... I support compulsory transfer. I don't see in it anything immoral, but compulsory transfer can only be affected by England and not by the Jews... Not only is it inconceivable for us to carry it out, but it is also inconceivable for us to propose it.\"\n\nThe Woodhead Commission in 1938 noted that:\n\n\" On behalf of the Jews it was made clear to us that Jewish opinion was opposed to the exercise of any degree of compulsion.\"\n\nHe restates what he means in his letter to Amos in 1937:\n\n\" When I weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the committee's plan against my plan, I find it overall better. In two major things, whose value cannot be estimated, the committee's proposal excels: a. Handing over the entire Galilee to the Jews and placing our northern border on the Lebanon border. This neighborhood has immense political value, because Lebanon and the Jews are both interested in this neighborhood. The Christians in Lebanon can hardly exist without a Jewish state next to them, and we too are interested in an alliance with Christian Lebanon. b. The proposal of the transfer (relocation) of the Arabs from our valleys. We cannot and are not entitled to propose such a thing, because we never wanted to dispossess the Arabs. But since England is handing over a part of the land, which was promised to us, to an Arab state, it is only fair that the Arabs in our state be transferred to the Arab part.\"\n\n\"The Arabs will have to go, but one needs an opportune moment for making it happen, such as a war.\"\n\nThe reason for the strange internal quotations is likely because this quote is a fabrication. Pappe's quote appears absolutely nowhere, and Ben-Gurion does not say a war is \"necessary\" to expel the Arabs, nor does he mention a war in that sentence or the ones before or after; the quote in fuller context is that, after discussing a hypothetical where the Arab world refuses to allow a Jewish state to be populated by Jews. \n\n\" All of our ambitions are built on the assumption that has proven true throughout all of our activities in the land \\[of Israel\\] — that there is enough room for us and for the Arabs in the land \\[of Israel\\]. And if we will have to use force, not for the sake of evicting the Arabs of the Negev or Transjordan, but rather in order to secure the right that belongs to us to settle there, force will be available to us...We do not want to and we do not have to expel Arabs and take their place.\"\n\nThis fake quotation is a paraphrase by Israeli anti-Zionist Ilan Pappé, which was published in the Journal of Palestine Studies, and attributed to a 1937 letter that Ben Gurion wrote his son.\n\n\"The starting point for a solution of the question of the Arabs in the Jewish State is, in his view, the need to prepare the ground for an Arab—Jewish agreement; he supports \\[the establishment of\\] the Jewish State \\[on a small part of Palestine\\], not because he is satisfied with part of the country, but on the basis of the assumption that after we constitute a large force following the establishment of the state — we will cancel the partition \\[of the country between Jews and Arabs\\] and we will expand throughout the Land of Israel.\n\nMr. Shapira \\[a JAE member\\]: \" By force as well?\"\n\nMr. Ben-Gurion: \" \\[No\\]. Through mutual understanding and Jewish-Arab agreement.\"\n\nThis full quote can be found in Efraim Karsh's \"Falsifying the Record\". The idea was to expand land and the state throughout Palestine by working with the Arabs, not by rejecting partition or using it as a foot in the door.\n\n\" If I knew that it would be possible to save all the children in Germany by transporting them to England, and only half by transporting them to the Land of Israel, then I would opt for the second alternative. For we must weigh not only the life of these children, but also the history of the People of Israel.\"\n\nThis is very well used, so to clear it up, in this context, he's talking about Kristallnacht, during debates within the Zionist movement about how to respond to the growing Nazi threat. If all the Jews were to be taken to Britain, then there is a high chance Jews would have all be murdered because if you know history, Germany was very close to invading England, and Jews were dying in the masses. He was thinking about a permanent solution where Jews can still live.\n\n\" The acceptance of partition does not commit us to renounce Transjordan: one does not demand from anybody to give up his vision. We shall accept a state in the boundaries fixed today, but the boundaries of Zionist aspirations are the concern of the Jewish people, and no external factor will be able to limit them.\"\n\nThis quote, too, is addressed by the above clarification of Ben-Gurion's beliefs. As Karsh talks about with reference to the letter Ben-Gurion sent to his son Amos, which is frequently cited but not actually examined in totality. And again, we are still suffering from opinions made 10 years prior, before the Holocaust and WWII and the like. These things could easily have shifted Ben-Gurion's opinion, especially as he said in 1947:\n\n\" Chairman: \"Do you give preference to a federal State or a partition scheme?\"\n\nBen Gurion: \"We want to have a State of our own, and that State can be federate if the other State or States is or are willing to do so in the mutual interest, on condition that our State is in its own right a Member of the United Nations.\"\n\nNote that he accepts another state in this discussion, indicating favor towards partition and possible federation (i.e. the economic union proposed in UNSCOP). He also says later in his testimony: \n\n\" I will tell you what we told the Government last year and this year while we believe and request that our right, at least to the Western part of Palestine should be granted in full and Western Palestine be made a Jewish State, we believe it is possible. We have a right to it, but we are willing to consider an offer of a Jewish State in an area which means less than the whole of Palestine. We will consider it.\"\n\nNow, note that Ben-Gurion is one of the most prominent leaders in history, but the second-most prominent is not Menachem Begin. It was not Begin who was testifying in front of UNSCOP, it was Chaim Weizmann, who would become the first President of Israel. Weizmann is mentioned by Ben-Gurion in that same testimony.\n\n\" Dr. Weizmann is thought so well of by the Jewish people and occupies such a place in our history and among us that he is entitled to speak for himself without any public mandate.\"\n\nNow, Weizmann is recognized as instrumental in the creation of the Jewish state: he was influential with the United States, well-loved by Jews 'round the world, and a huge leader. The reason Ben-Gurion eclipses him is partially because of Ben-Gurion's leadership of the Histadrut and election as Prime Minister, and partially because Ben-Gurion stayed prominent in politics for a very, very long time, steering the country through everything from the Suez Crisis to the acquisition of arms from the French that helped Israel win in 1967, and he was prominent in commanding forces during the 1948 war. Weizmann was a diplomat and politician but spoke for far more of the Jewish populace than begin. And Weizmann was far more fervent about partition than Ben-Gurion even, as noted by the committee members themselves, who said:\n\n\" I presume that Ben-Gurion has listened to the statement of Dr. Weizmann, which was acknowledged with enthusiastic applause by the public. This statement favors a partition of Palestine into two states.\"\n\nFive days after the UN resolution, on December 3, 1947, Ben-Gurion said in a speech:\n\n\" In our state, there will be non-Jews as well, and all of them will be equal citizens, equal in everything without exception. That is, the state will be their state as well.” Ben-Gurion also called for the implementation of the partition in 1947.\"\n\nHowever, in May 1948, Ben-Gurion rightfully said:\n\n\" We accepted the UN partition, but the Arabs did not. They are preparing to make war on us. If we defeat them and capture western Galilee or territory on both sides of the road to Jerusalem, these areas will become part of the state. Why should we obligate ourselves to accept boundaries that the Arabs don’t accept?\"\n\nConclusion:\n\nThere is no doubt that Zionist leaders were clearly interested in getting more land in the partition. However, they have never stated to conquer the entire Middle East, or Palestine. In their defense, countries, like Britain, promised the Mandate to be a Jewish National Homeland (with continuous Jewish immigration). After the 1929 and 1936, there was shift in British policy, and would later battle the Zionists. \n\nI think it would be hypocritical to not mention Arab leader's ambitions to be the King of Syria like King Abdullah. At the end of the day, he still negotiated with the Jews to not participate in the 48 war (in military terms, not policy). I think if Arab leaders showed interest in negotiating, Zionists would have agreed. The idea that they would still expelled/invaded Arabs with both sides agreeing to peace is just Arab fantasy land. \n\nThough, people like Begin didn't like the partition, because he was a revisionist Zionist, who wanted Jordan to be a Jewish state. However, he was involved with a terrorist group that was hunted by the Hagenah and British. I'm going to be making a post about Britain as well, and their policies. There are a million quotes out there, so comment any I could review! I just wanted to post some about the partition specifically. \n\n",

    "selftext": "Albert Einstein the Zionist\n\nAlbert Einstein was a Zionist. A German Jew who was ejected from Germany by the Nazis, Einstein viewed the founding of the state of Israel as a very good thing. He was a sort of a Zionist lobbyist. \n\nIndeed, Einstein lobbied for the creation of the state, as proposed in the UN General Assembly partition plan of 1947. The Arabs of course rejected the plan. Einstein passionately endorsed partition. \n\nIn the months preceding the vote for partition, Einstein wrote a letter to India’s prime minister, pleading for India to vote for partition. Einstein is often described as an “anti Zionist,” but some of the things written by him to the Indian leader would be considered “far right” by today’s leftists.\n\nIn the letter, Einstein essentially says - there is no Palestinian people. They’re part of an Arab nation. The Arabs have many lands. The Jews just want a tiny piece of the land. \n\nHe wrote to India’s prime minister\n\n “At the close of world war 1, 99% of the vast, underpopulated territories liberated from the Turks by the Allies were set aside for the national aspirations of the Arabs. Five independent Arab states have since been established in these territories.Only 1% was reserved for the Jewish people in the land of their origin. The decision which led to the proclamation of the Balfour Declaration was not arbitrary, nor the choice of territory capricious. It took into account the needs and aspirations of both Arab and Jew, and certainly, the lion’s share did not fall to the Jews. In the august scale of justice,which weighs need against need, there is not doubt as to whose is more heavy.  The “small notch” in the land of their fathers, granted the Jewish people, somewhat redresses the balance.” \n\nEinstein endorses the Balfour Declaration, universally viewed by radical leftists as evil, while saying “the Arabs have many states and they’re vast. The Jews only want one state in their ancient homeland”. \nSource: \nhttps://hvk.org/2017/0717/18.html \n\nEinstein’s Zionist lobbying continued after the founding of the state. In the 1950s, Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben Gurion, offered Einstein to become Israel’s president. Ben Gurion and Einstein were quite close. Both were Zionist and both were socialists. While Einstein was more socialistic than Ben Gurion, Ben Gurion were unironically socialist (Ben Gurion actually visited the Soviet Union once and spoke highly of Lenin. Ben Gurion later claimed his wife, Paula Ben Gurion, had a crush of Leon Trotsky when she was a young Jewish anarchist in New York City). \n\nBen Gurion would not have offered the presidency to a man who he didn’t think with a 100% certainty was not worthy of it as a Zionist. \n\nEinstein politely declined. “I’m a scientist, not a politician,” he told Ben Gurion. \n\nNevertheless, Einstein’s Zionist activism continued. In 1955, he was slated to read a speech on the radio in favor of Israel.\n\nThe speech was written by no other than Abba Eben, one of Israel’s most prominent diplomats. The speech condemned Arab hostility towards Israel. It drew a direct line between the Holocaust and Arab states’ aggression towards the Jewish state. A speech written by Abba Eben, this was an unmistakably Zionist speech. \n\nThe speech said: \n\n“The establishment of this State was internationally approved and recognised largely for the purpose of rescuing the remnant of the Jewish people from unspeakable horrors of persecution and oppression .  . Thus, the establishment of Israel is an event which actively engages the conscience of this generation,” he continued. “It is, therefore, a bitter paradox to find that a State which was destined to be a shelter for a martyred people is itself threatened by grave dangers to its own security. The universal conscience cannot be indifferent to such peril” \n\nEinstein strongly condemned Israel’s critics: “It is anomalous that world opinion should only criticize Israel’s response to hostility and should not actively seek to bring an end to the Arab hostility which is the root cause of the tension” \n\nSource \n\nhttps://www.algemeiner.com/2013/04/17/einsteins-never-before-seen-israel-independence-day-speech-revealed/\n\nEinstein died before making the address. After his death, he donated his writings to the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where his personal files are still stored. To commemorate Einstein’s life and contributions to the Jewish state, Israel printed his image on the 5 Israeli pound bill (Israel’s currency before the shekel was called Israeli pound). \n\n\nSource \nhttps://www.globecoins.com/שטר-5-לירות-1968-איינשטיין-בנק-ישראל\n\n\nSo there you have it - Albert Einstein, a friend of Israel. Next time you read some propaganda piece about Einstein and Zionism, keep this all in mind. When you know the facts, propaganda loses its power. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Many Pro-Palestinians have to face the reality that Jews really did want peace and were fine with partition. To contradict this well-founded fact, they have to spout out random quotes, and maybe some of the most idiotic contradictions. There are a bunch of quotes from the Israeli side, but I need to clear these up because they are the easiest copy and paste. \n\n1937 Peel Commission\n\nFollowing the publication, in 1938 the Woodhead Commission was appointed to examine it in detail and recommend an actual partition plan. The Jewish Agency accepted the idea of partition, however, didn’t agree with the borders or transfer. Prior to the report’s publication, there was indication that the Nashashibis, backed by Jordan’s Amir Abdullah, were in favor of partition. That was the reason given for the party’s reason to withdraw from the Arab Higher Committee, which were strictly opposed to partition. No Arabs came forward to submit evidence, though king Abdullah of Transjordan wrote to Woodhead giving support for partition as well as receiving the Commission in Amman. Assassination attempts against opposition leaders may have well frightened the Nashashibis too. Even in the Peel plan, it highly doubted that 200,000 Arabs could be moved to the Southern part of the Mandate. They suggested a voluntary movement by promising new opportunities. \n\nThe Woodhead Commission considered three different plans, one of which was based on the Peel plan. Reporting in 1938, the Woodhead Commission rejected the Peel plan primarily on the grounds that it could not be implemented without a massive, forced transfer of Arabs (an option that the British government had already ruled out). Had the Mufti favored the partition, the British would have preferred his rule over Abdullah. In Lebanon the Maronites initially also welcomed a Jewish state, which would break the hostile ring of Muslim Arabs. Ben Gurion thought that had the partition plan been carried out, the Holocaust could have had a different effect. If the British fully endorsed and promoted the plan, it could have been implemented with the support of the local Zionists and Arab armies forces in favor. For 1948, there was indication of certain leaders and institutions willing to cooperate with the UNCOP, however the Arab Higher Committee policy silenced any opposition. \n\nLet's start: \n\n\" I don’t understand your optimism...why would Arabs make peace? If I were an Arab leader, I would never sign an agreement with Israel. It is normal; we have taken their country. It is true God promised it to us, but how could that interest them? Our God is not theirs. There has been antisemitism, the Nazis, Hitler, Auschwitz, but was that their fault? They see but one thing: we have come and we have stolen their country. Why would they accept that?\"\n\nWe actually don’t even know if this quote is real. It’s attributed to Nahum Goldmann, who alleged Ben Gurion said this to him in his book Le Paraddoxe Juif in a private conversation. Ben Gurion was describing the Arab perspective of the conflict; he was not suggesting that he believed those things himself. In fact, Goldmann described Ben Gurion as pessimistic about the prospects for peace specifically because the Arab countries had this opinion of the Jewish state.\n\n\"Let us not ignore the truth among ourselves ... politically we are the aggressors and they defend themselves... The country is theirs, because they inhabit it, whereas we want to come here and settle down, and in their view we want to take away from them their country.\"\n\nThis quote explains the same thing. Ben Gurion definitely understood the Arab world's logic for their disapproval of Israel, but no Zionists ever took it seriously. \n\n\" I saw in the Peel Plan two positive things: the ideas of a state and compulsory transfer... I support compulsory transfer. I don't see in it anything immoral, but compulsory transfer can only be affected by England and not by the Jews... Not only is it inconceivable for us to carry it out, but it is also inconceivable for us to propose it.\"\n\nThe Woodhead Commission in 1938 noted that:\n\n\" On behalf of the Jews it was made clear to us that Jewish opinion was opposed to the exercise of any degree of compulsion.\"\n\nHe restates what he means in his letter to Amos in 1937:\n\n\" When I weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the committee's plan against my plan, I find it overall better. In two major things, whose value cannot be estimated, the committee's proposal excels: a. Handing over the entire Galilee to the Jews and placing our northern border on the Lebanon border. This neighborhood has immense political value, because Lebanon and the Jews are both interested in this neighborhood. The Christians in Lebanon can hardly exist without a Jewish state next to them, and we too are interested in an alliance with Christian Lebanon. b. The proposal of the transfer (relocation) of the Arabs from our valleys. We cannot and are not entitled to propose such a thing, because we never wanted to dispossess the Arabs. But since England is handing over a part of the land, which was promised to us, to an Arab state, it is only fair that the Arabs in our state be transferred to the Arab part.\"\n\n\"The Arabs will have to go, but one needs an opportune moment for making it happen, such as a war.\"\n\nThe reason for the strange internal quotations is likely because this quote is a fabrication. Pappe's quote appears absolutely nowhere, and Ben-Gurion does not say a war is \"necessary\" to expel the Arabs, nor does he mention a war in that sentence or the ones before or after; the quote in fuller context is that, after discussing a hypothetical where the Arab world refuses to allow a Jewish state to be populated by Jews. \n\n\" All of our ambitions are built on the assumption that has proven true throughout all of our activities in the land \\[of Israel\\] — that there is enough room for us and for the Arabs in the land \\[of Israel\\]. And if we will have to use force, not for the sake of evicting the Arabs of the Negev or Transjordan, but rather in order to secure the right that belongs to us to settle there, force will be available to us...We do not want to and we do not have to expel Arabs and take their place.\"\n\nThis fake quotation is a paraphrase by Israeli anti-Zionist Ilan Pappé, which was published in the Journal of Palestine Studies, and attributed to a 1937 letter that Ben Gurion wrote his son.\n\n\"The starting point for a solution of the question of the Arabs in the Jewish State is, in his view, the need to prepare the ground for an Arab—Jewish agreement; he supports \\[the establishment of\\] the Jewish State \\[on a small part of Palestine\\], not because he is satisfied with part of the country, but on the basis of the assumption that after we constitute a large force following the establishment of the state — we will cancel the partition \\[of the country between Jews and Arabs\\] and we will expand throughout the Land of Israel.\n\nMr. Shapira \\[a JAE member\\]: \" By force as well?\"\n\nMr. Ben-Gurion: \" \\[No\\]. Through mutual understanding and Jewish-Arab agreement.\"\n\nThis full quote can be found in Efraim Karsh's \"Falsifying the Record\". The idea was to expand land and the state throughout Palestine by working with the Arabs, not by rejecting partition or using it as a foot in the door.\n\n\" If I knew that it would be possible to save all the children in Germany by transporting them to England, and only half by transporting them to the Land of Israel, then I would opt for the second alternative. For we must weigh not only the life of these children, but also the history of the People of Israel.\"\n\nThis is very well used, so to clear it up, in this context, he's talking about Kristallnacht, during debates within the Zionist movement about how to respond to the growing Nazi threat. If all the Jews were to be taken to Britain, then there is a high chance Jews would have all be murdered because if you know history, Germany was very close to invading England, and Jews were dying in the masses. He was thinking about a permanent solution where Jews can still live.\n\n\" The acceptance of partition does not commit us to renounce Transjordan: one does not demand from anybody to give up his vision. We shall accept a state in the boundaries fixed today, but the boundaries of Zionist aspirations are the concern of the Jewish people, and no external factor will be able to limit them.\"\n\nThis quote, too, is addressed by the above clarification of Ben-Gurion's beliefs. As Karsh talks about with reference to the letter Ben-Gurion sent to his son Amos, which is frequently cited but not actually examined in totality. And again, we are still suffering from opinions made 10 years prior, before the Holocaust and WWII and the like. These things could easily have shifted Ben-Gurion's opinion, especially as he said in 1947:\n\n\" Chairman: \"Do you give preference to a federal State or a partition scheme?\"\n\nBen Gurion: \"We want to have a State of our own, and that State can be federate if the other State or States is or are willing to do so in the mutual interest, on condition that our State is in its own right a Member of the United Nations.\"\n\nNote that he accepts another state in this discussion, indicating favor towards partition and possible federation (i.e. the economic union proposed in UNSCOP). He also says later in his testimony: \n\n\" I will tell you what we told the Government last year and this year while we believe and request that our right, at least to the Western part of Palestine should be granted in full and Western Palestine be made a Jewish State, we believe it is possible. We have a right to it, but we are willing to consider an offer of a Jewish State in an area which means less than the whole of Palestine. We will consider it.\"\n\nNow, note that Ben-Gurion is one of the most prominent leaders in history, but the second-most prominent is not Menachem Begin. It was not Begin who was testifying in front of UNSCOP, it was Chaim Weizmann, who would become the first President of Israel. Weizmann is mentioned by Ben-Gurion in that same testimony.\n\n\" Dr. Weizmann is thought so well of by the Jewish people and occupies such a place in our history and among us that he is entitled to speak for himself without any public mandate.\"\n\nNow, Weizmann is recognized as instrumental in the creation of the Jewish state: he was influential with the United States, well-loved by Jews 'round the world, and a huge leader. The reason Ben-Gurion eclipses him is partially because of Ben-Gurion's leadership of the Histadrut and election as Prime Minister, and partially because Ben-Gurion stayed prominent in politics for a very, very long time, steering the country through everything from the Suez Crisis to the acquisition of arms from the French that helped Israel win in 1967, and he was prominent in commanding forces during the 1948 war. Weizmann was a diplomat and politician but spoke for far more of the Jewish populace than begin. And Weizmann was far more fervent about partition than Ben-Gurion even, as noted by the committee members themselves, who said:\n\n\" I presume that Ben-Gurion has listened to the statement of Dr. Weizmann, which was acknowledged with enthusiastic applause by the public. This statement favors a partition of Palestine into two states.\"\n\nFive days after the UN resolution, on December 3, 1947, Ben-Gurion said in a speech:\n\n\" In our state, there will be non-Jews as well, and all of them will be equal citizens, equal in everything without exception. That is, the state will be their state as well.” Ben-Gurion also called for the implementation of the partition in 1947.\"\n\nHowever, in May 1948, Ben-Gurion rightfully said:\n\n\" We accepted the UN partition, but the Arabs did not. They are preparing to make war on us. If we defeat them and capture western Galilee or territory on both sides of the road to Jerusalem, these areas will become part of the state. Why should we obligate ourselves to accept boundaries that the Arabs don’t accept?\"\n\nConclusion:\n\nThere is no doubt that Zionist leaders were clearly interested in getting more land in the partition. However, they have never stated to conquer the entire Middle East, or Palestine. In their defense, countries, like Britain, promised the Mandate to be a Jewish National Homeland (with continuous Jewish immigration). After the 1929 and 1936, there was shift in British policy, and would later battle the Zionists. \n\nI think it would be hypocritical to not mention Arab leader's ambitions to be the King of Syria like King Abdullah. At the end of the day, he still negotiated with the Jews to not participate in the 48 war (in military terms, not policy). I think if Arab leaders showed interest in negotiating, Zionists would have agreed. The idea that they would still expelled/invaded Arabs with both sides agreeing to peace is just Arab fantasy land. \n\nThough, people like Begin didn't like the partition, because he was a revisionist Zionist, who wanted Jordan to be a Jewish state. However, he was involved with a terrorist group that was hunted by the Hagenah and British. I'm going to be making a post about Britain as well, and their policies. There are a million quotes out there, so comment any I could review! I just wanted to post some about the partition specifically. \n\n",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI’m a British Indian Hindu and a Kashmiri Pandit, and the Israel–Palestine conflict has caused me a lot of personal grief. Terrorism from Pakistan killed members of my extended family, and because of that I grew up instinctively sympathetic to Israel. Today, I still believe Israel has a fundamental right to exist and value that it is a democratic state.\n\nHowever, I’ve become increasingly appalled by Israel’s policies toward Palestinians. I struggle to reconcile how Israelis can live freely, travel, and pursue high‑tech or entrepreneurial careers, while Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank are confined to fragmented enclaves with severe restrictions on movement, trade, and economic opportunity. Many Palestinians, despite being educated and capable, can only aspire to low‑wage work in Israel under precarious permits, while their communities remain underdeveloped.\n\nSettler violence in the West Bank is another major concern. Palestinians have no standing army or meaningful protection on their own land, and attacks on homes, farms, and livelihoods often go unpunished or receive minimal response. Meanwhile, even a single Palestinian attack triggers a massive military response. The imbalance is stark and deeply unfair. Settler attacks are very deadly, if someone challenges me I can easily provide statistics on the settler attacks and I can challenge the intifadas as a basis for Israel’s crippling measures. \n\nI understand that some argue that Palestinians elect extremist or militant governments, such as Hamas in Gaza, which complicates governance and security. But this cannot fully justify crippling millions of civilians. Statistically, terror attacks in Israel are relatively rare—comparable to rates of violent crime in developed countries—yet the collective restrictions placed on Palestinians vastly exceed the actual threat.\n\nThe economic and social disparity is heart-wrenching. Israelis can aspire to normal, fulfilling lives, while Palestinian communities are denied basic opportunities. Seeing Israelis live happily under these circumstances makes me feel conflicted and upset, because that happiness comes at the expense of others’ suffering.\n\nI want to do something constructive. I would like to advocate for policies that allow Palestinians greater economic freedom, trade, and mobility. I also wonder if there could be some form of neutral international protection, perhaps through the UN or other multinational arrangements, to reduce settler violence and protect civilians.\n\nI’m not posting to deny Israel’s security concerns, but I am struggling to reconcile support for Israel’s right to exist with the ongoing oppression and suffering of Palestinians. I would deeply appreciate thoughtful discussion: how can people outside the region advocate for Palestinian economic and human development effectively, without escalating conflict?\n\nI call for all Hindus to stop their unlimited support for Israel, just because of our own experience with Pakistan, at least question what is it we are supporting.

Terrorism from Pakistan killed members of my extended family, and because of that I grew up instinctively sympathetic to Israel. Today, I still believe Israel has a fundamental right to exist and value that it is a democratic state.\n\nHowever, I’ve become increasingly appalled by Israel’s policies toward Palestinians. I struggle to reconcile how Israelis can live freely, travel, and pursue high‑tech or entrepreneurial careers, while Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank are confined to fragmented enclaves with severe restrictions on movement, trade, and economic opportunity. Many Palestinians, despite being educated and capable, can only aspire to low‑wage work in Israel under precarious permits, while their communities remain underdeveloped.\n\nSettler violence in the West Bank is another major concern. Palestinians have no standing army or meaningful protection on their own land, and attacks on homes, farms, and livelihoods often go unpunished or receive minimal response. Meanwhile, even a single Palestinian attack triggers a massive military response. The imbalance is stark and deeply unfair. Settler attacks are very deadly, if someone challenges me I can easily provide statistics on the settler attacks and I can challenge the intifadas as a basis for Israel’s crippling measures. \n\nI understand that some argue that Palestinians elect extremist or militant governments, such as Hamas in Gaza, which complicates governance and security. But this cannot fully justify crippling millions of civilians. Statistically, terror attacks in Israel are relatively rare—comparable to rates of violent crime in developed countries—yet the collective restrictions placed on Palestinians vastly exceed the actual threat.\n\nThe economic and social disparity is heart-wrenching. Israelis can aspire to normal, fulfilling lives, while Palestinian communities are denied basic opportunities. Seeing Israelis live happily under these circumstances makes me feel conflicted and upset, because that happiness comes at the expense of others’ suffering.\n\nI want to do something constructive. I would like to advocate for policies that allow Palestinians greater economic freedom, trade, and mobility.

    "title": "British Indian Hindu deeply troubled by the oppression of Palestinians",
    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI’m a British Indian Hindu and a Kashmiri Pandit, and the Israel–Palestine conflict has caused me a lot of personal grief. Terrorism from Pakistan killed members of my extended family, and because of that I grew up instinctively sympathetic to Israel. Today, I still believe Israel has a fundamental right to exist and value that it is a democratic state.\n\nHowever, I’ve become increasingly appalled by Israel’s policies toward Palestinians. I struggle to reconcile how Israelis can live freely, travel, and pursue high‑tech or entrepreneurial careers, while Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank are confined to fragmented enclaves with severe restrictions on movement, trade, and economic opportunity. Many Palestinians, despite being educated and capable, can only aspire to low‑wage work in Israel under precarious permits, while their communities remain underdeveloped.\n\nSettler violence in the West Bank is another major concern. Palestinians have no standing army or meaningful protection on their own land, and attacks on homes, farms, and livelihoods often go unpunished or receive minimal response. Meanwhile, even a single Palestinian attack triggers a massive military response. The imbalance is stark and deeply unfair. Settler attacks are very deadly, if someone challenges me I can easily provide statistics on the settler attacks and I can challenge the intifadas as a basis for Israel’s crippling measures. \n\nI understand that some argue that Palestinians elect extremist or militant governments, such as Hamas in Gaza, which complicates governance and security. But this cannot fully justify crippling millions of civilians. Statistically, terror attacks in Israel are relatively rare—comparable to rates of violent crime in developed countries—yet the collective restrictions placed on Palestinians vastly exceed the actual threat.\n\nThe economic and social disparity is heart-wrenching. Israelis can aspire to normal, fulfilling lives, while Palestinian communities are denied basic opportunities. Seeing Israelis live happily under these circumstances makes me feel conflicted and upset, because that happiness comes at the expense of others’ suffering.\n\nI want to do something constructive. I would like to advocate for policies that allow Palestinians greater economic freedom, trade, and mobility. I also wonder if there could be some form of neutral international protection, perhaps through the UN or other multinational arrangements, to reduce settler violence and protect civilians.\n\nI’m not posting to deny Israel’s security concerns, but I am struggling to reconcile support for Israel’s right to exist with the ongoing oppression and suffering of Palestinians. I would deeply appreciate thoughtful discussion: how can people outside the region advocate for Palestinian economic and human development effectively, without escalating conflict?\n\nI call for all Hindus to stop their unlimited support for Israel, just because of our own experience with Pakistan, at least question what is it we are supporting.

Given all of this, I could see why some conclude that the way that Trump is composing the board of peace is a negative thing for Israel.\n\nHowever, if you think about the contents of the United Nations security council resolution that ended the war, you would see that they are very favorable to Israel and lead to an outcome that I believe many American Jews want for the state of Israel. it involves Hamas being de radicalized, Gaza being demilitarized. in order for that to happen and in order for there to be legitimacy around this happening, there must be a well balanced board and international coalition driving this forward. There is no way that Hamas would disarm if the Board of peace were composed solely of countries favorable to Israel. There is no way that Gaza would be deradicalized after decades of supposed stewardship by an international organization UNRWA which resulted in a deeply biased and radicalized population due to the education system which the UN had administered. in order for all of this change to be possible the countries that support the Palestinian people must be closely involved in bringing that solution to fruition or making that solution a reality that is why I believe that inviting countries like Qatar, Turkey and Pakistan to the board of peace was a stroke of genius by President Trump and Jared Kushner. \n\nDo you agree?

    "selftext": "If you look at the Israeli Press, such as the times of Israel or Jerusalem Post, you would think that the composition of the board of peace executive board is a negative thing for Israel countries such as Qatar and Turkey and Pakistan, which have all been invited to join the board of peace. In addition to that there are other countries such as Canada and United Kingdom, which are western countries, but have also been hostile to Israel over the past couple of years. Given all of this, I could see why some conclude that the way that Trump is composing the board of peace is a negative thing for Israel.\n\nHowever, if you think about the contents of the United Nations security council resolution that ended the war, you would see that they are very favorable to Israel and lead to an outcome that I believe many American Jews want for the state of Israel. it involves Hamas being de radicalized, Gaza being demilitarized. in order for that to happen and in order for there to be legitimacy around this happening, there must be a well balanced board and international coalition driving this forward. There is no way that Hamas would disarm if the Board of peace were composed solely of countries favorable to Israel. There is no way that Gaza would be deradicalized after decades of supposed stewardship by an international organization UNRWA which resulted in a deeply biased and radicalized population due to the education system which the UN had administered. in order for all of this change to be possible the countries that support the Palestinian people must be closely involved in bringing that solution to fruition or making that solution a reality that is why I believe that inviting countries like Qatar, Turkey and Pakistan to the board of peace was a stroke of genius by President Trump and Jared Kushner. \n\nDo you agree? If not, what do you believe Trump should have done when building this board of peace?",

    "title": "The two kinds of antizionist justification: They hate Israel for Who Israelis are V. what Israel does",
    "selftext": "I've found that, when you boil it down, there are basically two kinds of justification for antizionism. When an anti-Zionist starts out with one reason and argues with a Zionist and gets out-argued, they typically switch to the other reason.\n\n**1. Israel is bad because of who Jews are**\n\nThis is your basic settler-colonizer buzzword sandwich. Following this logic, Israel is bad because Jews are foreign European people who have no right to be in the Levant in the first place, and certainly no right to seek self determination there.\n\nTherefore, everything the true locals (Palestinians) do --- however much they murder, rape, displace Jews --- is justified, because they are getting rid of this fundamental evil that was never supposed to be there in the first place. Whatever Israelis do is wrong. Israelis cannot possibly do anything in self defense or response to aggression, because their very existence is offensive in the first place. Palestinians are allowed to kill Israelis, and Israelis are not allowed to fight back.\n\n**Where it falls apart:**\n\nThis argument falls apart because Jews are indigenous to Israel. They were displaced and taken away on slave ships, and after getting persecuted and displaced more, they finally returned to their ancestral homeland.\n\nAnyone who thinks an indigenous people should not return to their homeland and try to claim self determination there would have to say that Native Americans have no right to a land back movement, or displaced Palestinians for that matter have no right to go to Israel. Unless they choose some arbitrary number of years for an \"indigenous rightful owner\" to magically turn into a \"foreigner colonizer\", but ask them to give a specific number of years that isn't arbitrary, and they can't do it.\n\nSo when they realize this, they switch to point #1 with some transition line like \"Well, the problem isn't that Jews came back to Israel, the problem is that they displaced/killed so many Palestinians in the process!\"\n\n**2. Israel is bad because of what it does**\n\nThis is your basic genocide apartheid ethnic cleansing buzzword sandwich. Following this, the idea of Jews seeking self determination in their homeland was okay, but the problem is that those Jews turned out to be evil people who displace and murder peaceful Palestinians.\n\n**Where it falls apart:**\n\nThis falls apart because both Jews and Arabs engaged in violence against each other (and Arabs started each new round of the violence.). Pro-Palestinians basically have to leave out half the story.\n\nArabs started murdering and displacing Jews in the 1920s, long before Jews started responding by attacking them back. This pattern continued for the whole conflict: In 1948, Palestinian Arabs were offered their own country for the first time ever. Plus, Jews offered Arabs full citizenship and equal rights in Israel. Arabs responded by starting a war. Similar numbers of Palestinians and Jews were killed in that war. As the decades went on, the pattern continued: Arabs would attack first, and Israelis would fight back.\n\nPalestinians are in a worse situation than Israelis now because they keep starting wars and losing them, not because Israelis are somehow more brutal in their fighting (you could make an argument that Israel was less brutal up until a few years ago but more brutal in this particular war, but I've yet to hear a Pro-Palestinian make that argument).\n\nSo when Pro-Palestinians realize this argument is worthless, they switch to point 1 with some transition line like \"Well, the Palestinians are just fighting back against settler-colonizers!\"",

    "selftext": "I am not Jewish or evangelical Christian. I am a very passionate friend of Israel and the Jewish people. But I wasn't always that way...\n\nFor most of my life I was what I would call a \"non-Zionist.\" A person who really doesn't care strongly either way... Like perhaps Israel has some good and bad points and maybe Hamas has some good and bad points and they both need to stop fighting...\n\nThis is DESPITE having Jewish friends basically my entire life...\n\nAs a long term friend of Israel and Jewish people, I can say, that where the pro-Israel movement has failed in using its strongest weapon, which is simply true and unvarnished history. Not only in defending the position of the Jewish people and the world's only Jewish state, but in educating young people, but especially young Jews...\n\nIsrael and the Jewish people have made a LOT of mistakes throughout history. The prestate militias made a LOT of mistakes. We can't and there is no reason to hide from these. But while expressing regret for such mistakes and missteps, it is important that both Jews and non-Jews understand history from a 360 degree perspective... I do not in any way excuse or explain away any current or past mistakes.\n\nBut when a person has a FULL understanding of history, both the good and bad, it is obvious that Israel and the Jewish people are FAR, FAR more humane than ANY group of random people would have been facing the same situations and provocations and that is why I am myself pro-Israel and feel strongly about it.\n\nWe talk about Jewish mistakes. For example, not allying more with Mustafa al-Khalidi and his faction and WIPING OUT FULLY the pro-N@zi Amin Al-Husseini faction (supporters of the Amin Al-Husseini the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, and a leading supporter of the N@zis and the Final Solution) during what was essentially the Palestinian civil war -- that is another thing... there is an idea that the Palestinians were a monolith during this time -- they were not... Had the early Zionists ensured al-Khalidi and his faction won BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY. ANY MEANS, had they achieved power, they would have accepted the partition plan and while he was NOT a Zionist at ALL, he didn't believe in throwing all Jews into the sea. It would have been peace albeit a cold peace.\n\nBut at the same time, I do understand the pressures they were under and why the mistakes were made...\n\nSome of the early Zionists had \"understandings\" with not Al-Husseini himself but his family who sold the early Zionists LARGE tracts of land and were regularly selling them land and talking to them... Probably the early Zionist leaders thought that because his family was selling them land and therefore Al-Husseini, the pro-N@zi Grand Mufti of Jerusalem was benefiting from this and most likely he and his family said nice things to them behind the scenes he wasn't such a threat. What a HUGE mistake ...\n\nWe talk about anti-semetism -- let's say you are a young person, let's say you are similar to the way I used to be, I  knew NOTHING about the conflict. Most of Jewish friends and co-workers had NOTHING to say about Israel and nearly all of the ones who DID say anything, said bad things about it... So as a young person who knows nothing, what would myself or someone ELSE in my position think... how could we not be either non-Zionist or anti-Zionist if we are surrounded by an echo chamber of anti-Zionism and even our JEWISH friends, who we go to to get a different viewpoint, don't care or express certain anti-Zionist talking points... I mean how else could you end up...\n\nMy change only occurred when I started doing my OWN research and studying and later making friends with other pro-Israel Zionists who taught me more... But for me, my views are largely shaped by my own personal friendships with Jews for decades, since childhood, but beyond that, a deep understanding of history from BOTH sides. I am intimately familiar with both the arguments of anti-Zionists and certain Zionists and I understand the pluses and minuses of both sides, although of course I am pro-Israel, so I much mostly align with the Zionist arguments in regards to my personal views.\n\nOn the pro-Palesitnian side, from what I see, one reason why I reject them and their movement although I have compassion for Palestinains is I see that they selectively ignore and sometimes completely rewrite history in order to villify Jews. Once I noticed this pattern enough, it was hard for me to take ANYTHING they say seriously... they call Jews immigrating to Israel \"colonialists\" and occupiers. First of all Israel has ALWAYS been the home for the Jewish people. ALways. THey were NEVER recognized as full Europeans in the mid 19th century or earlier. NEVER. They were ALWAYS considered outsiders...\n\nBut let's talk about colonialism -- for centuries, the Ottoman Empire, primarily run by Europeans who CALLED themselves Ottomans, we are talking garden variety white people who were converts to Islam, who ran what was then called Palestine and the entire Middle East and Northern Africa... we talk about white colonialists and occupiers, if they are SOOO upset about occupation and white European invaders, why aren't they upset about the Ottoman Empire who again, was headed and run by people with WHITE EUROPEAN heritage...\n\nI personally don't care WHAT race a person is, but this is made such a big deal -- I can't help but point out the hypocrisy...\n\n  \n\n\nPS. Speaking of history. Another interesting fact. The Jews say they bought the land and the Arab Palestinians were upset because the land was \"stolen.\"\n\nLet me clarify that point... The Al-Husseni family and certain other rich families both in the Levant and in Turkey and in other areas, benefited from the Ottoman Land Act of 1858...\n\nThe \"Ottoman Land Code of 1858 linked land registration to military service, requiring landowners to register their property with the state, which often meant Muslim men faced conscription into the Ottoman Army, while many peasants avoided registration to evade service, taxes, or fees, leading to land being registered by local notables and altering social structures, especially in regions like Palestine. This reform aimed to increase state control and revenue but inadvertently created a system where land often became legally owned by absentee elites, despite peasants working it for generations.\"\n\nThat is it in a nutshell... basically land could have been passed from one generation to another for countless centuries but was in the hands legally of rich Turkish, Palestinian, Syrian or other land owners... in the late 19th century, decades after the Ottomans created this law (the law was again created decades before the advent of Zionism) the early Zionist wanted to BUY legally land in what was then called historical Palestine. The rich land owners who legally owned the land, had absolutely NO respect or care for Palestinian farmers who had been working the land for generations and they were happy to charge Jews 3X the real cost of the land and make a decent profit. They had no problem whatsoever with selling this land and making a quick buck...\n\nBesides various Turkish and other families, one of the many main families engaged in this was the family of the notorious Grand Muti of Jerusalem, the Al-Hussenis who were playing a double game, in regards to making money selling land to the Zionists and then at the same time stirring up ethnic and religious hatred towards them.\n\nSo in a way they are both correct. The Jews legally purchased the land from the owners who were Arab and Turkish elites. These elites did NOT care about the Palestinian farmers.\n\nNaturally if the land was sold, then whoever was there before got kicked out...\n\nMany Palestinians were left completely penniless and destitute, there only source of substance was the land they farmed and Amin Al-Husseni took advantage of this situation that his family and the family of other elites created to generate hatred and get power...",
